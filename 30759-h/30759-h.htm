<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crowd gave way and the car glided smoothly
up to the curb at the canopied entrance to the church.
The blackness of the wet November night was upon
the street. It had rained at intervals all day.</p>

<p>The pavements shone wetly like new paint in
the glimmer of the street lights, and rude shadows
gloomed in every cranny of the great stone building.</p>

<p>Betty, alone in the midst of her bridal finery,
shrank back from the gaze of the curious onlookers,
seeming very small like a thing of the air caught in
a mesh of the earth.</p>

<p>She had longed all day for this brief respite from
everyone, but it had passed before she could concentrate
her thoughts. She started forward, a flame
of rose for an instant in her white cheeks, but gone as
quickly. Her eyes reminded one of the stars among
the far-away clouds on a night of fitful storm with
only glimpses of their beauty in breaks of the overcast
sky. Her small hands gripped one another excitedly,
and the sweet lips were quivering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A white-gloved hand reached out to open the car
door, and other hands caught and cared for the billow
of satin and costly lace with which she was surrounded,
as if it, and not she, were the important one.</p>

<p>They led her up the curtained way, where envious
eyes peeped through a furtive rip in the canvas, or
craned around an opening to catch a better glimpse
of her loveliness, one little dark-eyed foreigner even
reached out a grimy, wondering finger to the silver
whiteness of her train; but she, all unknowing, trod
the carpeted path as in a dream.</p>

<p>The wedding march was just beginning. She
caught the distant notes, felt the hush as she approached
the audience, and wondered why the ordeal
seemed so much greater now that she was actually
come to the moment. If she had known it would be
like this&mdash;! Oh, why had she given in!</p>

<p>The guests had risen and were stretching their
necks for the first vision of her. The chaplet of
costly blossoms sat upon her brow and bound her
wedding veil floating mistily behind, but the lovely
head was bowed, not lifted proudly as a bride's
should be, and the little white glove that rested on
the arm of the large florid cousin trembled visibly.
The cousin was almost unknown until a few hours
before. His importance overpowered her. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
drooped her eyes and tried not to wish for the quiet,
gray-haired cousin of her own mother. It was so
strange for him to have failed her at the last moment,
when he had promised long ago to let nothing
hinder him from giving her away if she should ever
be married. His telegram, "Unavoidably detained,"
had been received but an hour before. He seemed
the only one of her kind, and now she was all alone.
All the rest were like enemies, although they professed
deep concern for her welfare; for they were
leagued together against all her dearest wishes, until
she had grown weary in the combat.</p>

<p>She gave a frightened glance behind as if some
intangible thing were following her. Was it a
hounding dread that after all she would not be free
after marriage?</p>

<p>With measured tread she passed the long white-ribboned
way, under arches that she never noticed,
through a sea of faces that she never saw, to the
altar smothered in flowers and tropical ferns. It
seemed interminable. Would it never end? They
paused at last, and she lifted frightened eyes to the
florid cousin, and then to the face of her bridegroom!</p>

<p>It was a breathless moment, and but for the deep
tones of the organ now hushing for the ceremony,
one of almost audible silence. No lovelier bride had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
trod those aisles in many a long year; so exquisite,
so small, so young&mdash;and so exceeding rich! The
guests were entranced, and every eye was greedily
upon her as the white-robed minister advanced with
his open book.</p>

<p>"Beloved, we are met together to-night to join
this man&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>At that word they saw the bride suddenly, softly
sink before them, a little white heap at the altar, with
the white face turned upward, the white eyelids
closed, the long dark lashes sweeping the pretty
cheek, the wedding veil trailing mistily about her
down the aisle, and her big bouquet of white roses
and maiden-hair ferns clasped listlessly in the white-gloved
hands.</p>

<p>For a moment no one stirred, so sudden, so unexpected
it was. It all seemed an astonishing part
of the charming spectacle. The gaping throng with
startled faces stood and stared. Above the huddled
little bride stood the bridegroom, tall and dark and
frowning, an angry red surging through his handsome
face. The white-haired minister, with two red
spots on his fine scholarly cheeks, stood grave with
troubled dignity, as though somehow he meant to
hold the little still bride responsible for this unseemly
break in his beautiful service. The organ died away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with a soft crash of the keys and pedals as if they
too leaped up to see; the scent of the lilies swept sickeningly
up in a great wave on the top of the silence.</p>

<p>In a moment all was confusion. The minister
stooped, the best man sprang into the aisle and lifted
the flower-like head. Some one produced a fan, and
one of the ushers hurried for a glass of water. A
physician struggled from his pew across the sittings
of three stout dowagers, and knelt, with practiced
finger on the little fluttering pulse. The bride's stepmother
roused to solicitous and anxious attention.
The organ came smartly up again in a hopeless tangle
of chords and modulations, trying to get its poise
once more. People climbed upon their seats to see,
or crowded out in the aisle curiously and unwisely
kind, and in the way. Then the minister asked the
congregation to be seated; and amid the rustle of
wedding finery into seats suddenly grown too narrow
and too low, the ushers gathered up the little inert
bride and carried her behind the palms across a hall
and into the vestry room. The stepmother and a
group of friends hurried after, and the minister requested
the people to remain quietly seated for a few
minutes. The organ by this time had recovered its
poise and was playing soft tender melodies, but the
excited audience was not listening:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought she looked ghastly when she came
in," declared the mother of three frowsy daughters.
"It's strange she didn't put on some rouge."</p>

<p>"Um-mm! What a pity! I suppose she isn't
strong! What did her own mother die of?" murmured
another speculatively, preparing to put forth
a theory before any one else got ahead of her.</p>

<p>"Oh! The poor child!" sympathized a romantic
friend. "They've been letting her do too much!
Didn't they make a handsome couple? I'm crazy to
see them come marching down the aisle. They surely
wouldn't put off the wedding just for a faint,
would they?"</p>

<p>And all over the church some woman began to tell
how her sister's child, or her brother's niece, or her
nephew's aunt had fainted just before her wedding
or during it, till it began to seem quite a common performance,
and one furnishing a unique and interesting
part of the program for a wedding ceremony.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on a couch in the big gloomy vestry
room lay Betty with a group of attendants about her.
Her eyes were closed, and she made no move. She
swallowed the aromatic ammonia that some one produced,
and she drew her breath a little less feebly,
but she did not open her eyes, nor respond when
they spoke to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Her stepmother stooped over finally and spoke
in her ear:</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Stanhope! sit up and control yourself!"
she said sharply in a low tone. "You are
making a spectacle of yourself that you can never
get over. Your father would be ashamed of you if
he were here!"</p>

<p>It was the one argument that had been held
a successful lash over her poor little quivering heart
for the last five years, and Betty flashed open her
sorrowful eyes and looked around on them with a
troubled concentration as if she were just taking in
what had happened:</p>

<p>"I'm so tired!" she said in a little weary voice.
"Won't you just let me get my breath a minute?"</p>

<p>The physician nodded emphatically toward the
door and motioned them out:</p>

<p>"She'll be all right in just a minute. Step outside
and give her a chance to get calm. She's only
worn out with excitement."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and looked furtively about
the room. There was no one there, and the door was
closed. She could hear them murmuring in low
tones just beyond it. She looked wildly about her
with a frantic thought of escape. The two windows
were deeply curtained, giving a narrow glimpse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
blank wall. She sprang softly to her feet and looked
out. There was a stone pavement far below. She
turned silently and tried a door. It opened into a
closet overflowing with musty hymn-books. She
closed it quickly and slipped back to her couch just
in time as the door opened and the doctor came back.
She could catch a glimpse of the others through the
half open door, anxiously peering in. She gathered
all her self-control and spoke:</p>

<p>"I'm all right now, Doctor," she said quite
calmly. "Would you just ask them to send Bessemer
here a minute?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." The doctor turned courteously and
went back to the door, half closing it and making
her request in a low tone. Then her stepmother's
excited sibilant whisper:</p>

<p>"Bessemer! Why, he isn't here! He went
down to the shore last night."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" came another voice, and the door
was shut smartly.</p>

<p>Betty's eyes grew wide with horror as she lay
staring at the closed door, and a cold numbness
seemed to envelop her, clutching at her throat, her
heart and threatening to overwhelm her.</p>

<p>Bessemer not here! What could it mean? Her
mind seemed unable to grasp and analyze the nameless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fear that awaited her outside that door. In a
moment more they would all swarm in and surround
her, and begin to clamor for her to go back into that
awful church&mdash;and <i>she could not</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">ever</span>! She would
far rather die!</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet again and glided noiselessly
to the only remaining uninvestigated door in
the room. If this was another closet she would
shut herself inside and stay till she died. She had
read tales of people dying in a small space from
lack of air. At least, if she did not die she could
stay here till she had time to think. There was a
key in the lock. Her fingers closed around it and
drew it stealthily from the keyhole, as she slid
through the door, drawing her rich draperies ruthlessly
after. Her fingers were trembling so that she
scarcely could fit the key in the lock again and
turn it, and every click of the metal, every creak of
the door, sounded like a gong in her ears. Her heart
was fluttering wildly and the blood seemed to be
pouring in torrents behind her ear-drums. She could
not be sure whether there were noises in the room she
had just left or not. She put her hand over her
heart, turned with a sickening dread to look about her
prison, and behold, it was not a closet at all, but a
dark landing to a narrow flight of stone steps that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
wound down out of sight into the shadows. With
a shudder she gathered her white impediment about
her and crept down the murky way, frightened, yet
glad to creep within the friendly darkness.</p>

<p>There were unmistakable sounds of footsteps
overhead now, and sharp exclamations. A hand
tried the door above and rattled it violently. For an
instant her heart beat frightfully in her throat at the
thought that perhaps after all she had not succeeded
in quite locking it, but the door held, and she flew on
blindly down the stairs, caring little where they led
only so that she might hide quickly before they found
the janitor and pried that door open.</p>

<p>The stairs ended in a little hall and a glass door.
She fumbled wildly with the knob. It was locked,
but there was a key! It was a large one and stuck,
and gave a great deal of trouble in turning. Her
fingers seemed so weak!</p>

<p>Above the noises grew louder. She fancied the
door was open and the whole churchful of people
were after her. She threw her full weight with fear
in the balance, and the key turned. She wrenched
it out of the rusty keyhole, slid out shutting the door
after her, and stooping, fitted in the key again. With
one more Herculean effort she locked it and
stood up, trembling so that she could scarcely keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
her balance. At least she was safe for a moment
and could get her breath. But where could she go?
She looked about her. High walls arose on either
hand, with a murky sky above. A stone walk filled
the space between and ran down the length of the
church to a big iron gate. The lights of the street
glistened fitfully on the puddles of wet in the depressions
of the paving-stones. The street looked quiet,
and only one or two people were passing. Was that
gate locked also, and if so could she ever climb it,
or break through? Somehow she must! She shuddered
at the thought of what would happen if she did
not get away at once. She strained at the buttons
on her soft white gloves and pulled the fingers off,
slipping her hands out and letting the glove hands
hang limp at her wrists. Then with a quick glance
backward at a flicker of light that appeared wavering
beyond the glass door, she gathered her draperies
again and fled down the long stone walk. Silently,
lightly as a ghost she passed, and crouched at the
gate as she heard footsteps, her heart beating so
loudly it seemed like a bell calling attention to her.
An old man was shuffling past, and she shrank
against the wall, yet mindful of the awful glass door
back at the end of the narrow passage. If they should
come now she could not hope to elude them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>She stooped and studied the gate latch. Yes, it
was a spring lock, and had no key in it. Stealthily
she tried it and found to her relief that it swung open.
She stepped around it and peered out. The gateway
was not more than a hundred feet from the brightly
lighted corner of the main avenue where rows of
automobiles were lined up waiting for the wedding
ceremony to be over. She could see the chauffeurs
walking back and forth and chatting together. She
could hear the desultory wandering of the organ,
too, from the partly open window near by. A faint
sickening waft of lily sweetness swept out, mingled
with a dash of drops from the maple tree on the
sidewalk. In a panic she stepped forth and drew
back again, suddenly realizing for the first time what
it would be to go forth into the streets clad in her
wedding garments? How could she do it and get
away? It could not be done!</p>

<p>Down the street, with a backward, wistful glance
at the church, hurried a large woman with a market
basket. Her curious eyes shone in the evening light
and darkness of the street. There was something
about her face that made Betty know instantly that
this woman would love to tell how she had seen her,
would gather a crowd in no time and pursue her.
She shrank farther back, and then waited in awful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fear and tried to listen again. Was that a rattling
at the glass door? She must get away no matter
what happened! Where? Was there an alleyway
or anything across the block? Could she hope to
cross the street between the shadows unnoticed?</p>

<p>She looked out fearfully once more. A girl of
her own age was approaching around the corner,
paddling along in rubbers, and a long coat. She
was chewing gum. Betty could see the outline of a
strong good-natured jaw working contentedly as she
was silhouetted against the light. She had her hands
in her pockets, and a little dark hat worn boyishly
on the back of her head, and she was humming a
popular song. Betty had slipped behind the half
open gate again and was watching her approach, her
desperation driving her to thoughts that never would
have entered her mind at another time. Suddenly,
as the girl passed directly in front of the gate, Betty
leaned forward and plucked at her sleeve:</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said sharply; and then, with a pitiful
pleading in her voice, "Won't you help me just
a minute, please?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> girl came to a standstill abruptly and faced
about, drawing away just a hair's-breadth from the
detaining hand, and surveying her steadily, the boyish
expression in her eyes changing to an amused calculation
such as one would fancy a cowboy held
up on his native plains by a stray lamb might
have worn.</p>

<p>"What's the little old idea!" asked the girl
coldly, her eyes narrowing as she studied the other
girl in detail and attempted to classify her into the
known and unknown quantities of her world. Her
face was absolutely expressionless as far as any sign
of interest or sympathy was concerned. It was like
a house with the door still closed and a well-trained
butler in attendance.</p>

<p>"I've got to get away from here at once before
anybody sees me," whispered Betty excitedly, with a
fearful glance behind her.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to call a cab for you?"
sneered the girl on the sidewalk, with an envious
glance at the white satin slippers.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Never!" cried Betty, wringing her
hands in desperation. "I want you to show me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
somewhere to go out of sight, and if you will
I'd like you to walk a block or so with me so I
won't be so&mdash;so conspicuous! I'm so frightened
I don't know which way to go."</p>

<p>"What do you want to go at all for?" asked
the girl bluntly, with the look of an inquisitor, and
the intolerance of the young for its contemporary
of another social class.</p>

<p>"Because I <i>must!</i>" said Betty with terror in her
voice. "They're coming! Listen! Oh, help me
quick! I can't wait to explain!"</p>

<p>Betty dashed out of the gate and would have
started up the street but that a strong young arm
came out like a flash and a firm young fist gripped her
arm like a vise. The girl's keen ears had caught
a sound of turning key and excited voices, and her
quick eyes pierced the darkness of the narrow court
and measured the distance back.</p>

<p>"Here! You can't go togged out like that!"
she ordered in quite a different tone. She flung off
her own long coat and threw it around the shrinking
little white figure, then knelt and deftly turned up
the long satin draperies out of sight and fixed them
firmly with a pin extracted from somewhere about
her person. Quickly she stood up and pulled off her
rubbers, her eye on the long dark passageway whence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
came now the decided sound of a forcibly opened
door and footsteps.</p>

<p>"Put these on, quick!" she whispered, lifting
first one slippered foot and then the other and supporting
the trembling Betty in her strong young
arms, while she snapped on the rubbers.</p>

<p>Lastly, she jerked the rakish hat from her own
head, crammed it down hard over the orange-wreathed
brow and gave her strange prot&eacute;g&eacute;e a
hasty shove.</p>

<p>"Now beat it around that corner and wait till I
come!" she whispered, and turning planted herself
in an idle attitude just under the church window,
craning her neck and apparently listening to the
music. A second later an excited usher, preceded by
the janitor, came clattering down the passageway.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any one go out of this gate
recently?" asked the usher.</p>

<p>The girl, hatless and coatless in the chill November
night, turned nonchalantly at the question, surveyed
the usher coolly from the point of his patent
leather shoes to the white gardenia in his buttonhole,
gave his features a cursory glance, and then shook
her head.</p>

<p>"There might have been an old woman come out
a while back. Dressed in black, was she? I wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
paying much attention. I think she went down the
avenoo," she said, and stretched her neck again,
standing on her tiptoes to view the wedding guests.
Her interest suddenly became real, for she spied a
young man standing in the church, in full view of
the window, back against the wall with his arms
folded, a fine handsome young man with pleasant
eyes and a head like that of a young nobleman, and
she wanted to make sure of his identity. He looked
very much like the young lawyer whose office boy
was her "gentleman friend." Just to make sure she
gave a little spring from the sidewalk that brought
her eyes almost on a level with the window and gave
her a brief glimpse, enough to see his face quite
clearly; then she turned with satisfaction to see that
the janitor and the usher had gone back up the
passageway, having slammed the gate shut. Without
more ado the girl wheeled and hurried down
the street toward the corner where Betty crouched
behind a tree trunk, watching fearfully for
her coming.</p>

<p>"Aw! You don't need to be that scared!" said
the girl, coming up. "They've gone back. I threw
'em off the scent. Come on! We'll go to my room
and see what to do. Don't talk! Somebody might
recognize your voice. Here, we'll cut through this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
alley and get to the next block. It's further away
and not so many folks passing."</p>

<p>Silently they hurried through the dark alley and
down the next street, Betty holding the long cloak
close that no gleam of her white satin might shine
out and give away her secret, her heart beating
like a trip hammer in her breast, her eyes filled with
unshed tears, the last words of her stepmother ringing
in her ears. Was she making her father
ashamed? Her dear dead father! Was she doing
the wrong thing? So long that thought had held
her! But she could not go back now. She had
taken an irrevocable step.</p>

<p>Her guide turned another corner abruptly and
led her up some stone steps to the door of a tall,
dingy brick house, to which she applied a latchkey.</p>

<p>The air of the gloomy hall was not pleasant. The
red wall-paper was soiled and torn, and weird
shadows flickered from the small gas taper that
blinked from the ceiling. There were suggestions
of old dinners, stale fried potatoes and pork in all
the corners, and one moving toward the stairs seemed
to stir them up and set them going again like
old memories.</p>

<p>The stairs were bare and worn by many feet,
and not particularly clean. Betty paused in dismay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
then hurried on after her hostess, who was mounting
up, one, two, three flights, to a tiny hall bedroom
at the back. A fleeting fear that perhaps the place
was not respectable shot through her heart, but her
other troubles were so great that it found no lodgment.
Panting and trembling she arrived at the top
and stood looking about her in the dark, while the
other girl found a match and lighted another wicked
little flickering gas-burner.</p>

<p>Then her hostess drew her into the room and
closed and locked the door. As a further precaution
she climbed upon a chair and pushed the transom
shut.</p>

<p>"Now," she said with a sigh of evident relief,
"we're safe! No one can hear you here, and you
can say what you please. But first we'll get this coat
and hat off and see what's the damage."</p>

<p>As gently as if she were undressing a baby the
girl removed the hat and coat from her guest, and
shook out the wonderful shining folds of satin. It
would have been a study for an artist to have
watched her face as she worked, smoothing out
wrinkles, shaking the lace down and uncrushing it,
straightening a bruised orange-blossom, and putting
everything in place. It was as if she herself were an
artist restoring a great masterpiece, so silently and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
absorbedly she worked, her eyes full of a glad wonder
that it had come to her once to be near and
handle anything so rare and costly. The very touch
of the lace and satin evidently thrilled her; the breath
of the exotic blossoms was nectar as she drew it in.</p>

<p>Betty was still panting from her climb, still
trembling from her flight, and she stood obedient and
meek while the other girl pulled and shook and
brushed and patted her into shape again. When
all was orderly and adjusted about the crumpled
bride, the girl stood back as far as the limits of the
tiny room allowed and surveyed the finished picture.</p>

<p>"There now! You certainly do look great!
That there band of flowers round your forehead
makes you look like some queen. 'Coronet'&mdash;ain't
that what they call it? I read that once in a story
at the Public Library. Say! Just to think I should
pick that up in the street! Good night! I'm glad
I came along just then instead o' somebody else!
This certainly is some picnic! Well, now, give us
your dope. It must've been pretty stiff to make you
cut and run from a show like the one they got up for
you! Come, tune up and let's hear the tale. I rather
guess I'm entitled to know before the curtain goes up
again on this little old stage!"</p>

<p>The two tears that had been struggling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Betty for a long time suddenly appeared in her eyes
and drowned them out, and in dismay she brought
out a faint little sorry giggle of apology and amusement
and dropped on the tiny bed, which filled up a
good two-thirds of the room.</p>

<p>"Good night!" exclaimed the hostess in alarm,
springing to catch her. "Don't drop down that
way in those glad rags! You'll finish 'em! Come,
stand up and we'll get 'em off. You look all in. I'd
oughta known you would be!" She lifted Betty
tenderly and began to remove her veil and unfasten
the wonderful gown. It seemed to her much like
helping an angel remove her wings for a nap. Her
eyes shone with genuine pleasure as she handled the
hooks deftly.</p>

<p>"But I've nothing else to put on!" gurgled
Betty helplessly.</p>

<p>"I have!" said the other girl.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Betty with a sudden thought. "I
wonder! Would you be willing to exchange clothes?
Have you perhaps got some things you don't need
that I could have, and I'll give you mine for them?
I don't suppose perhaps a wedding dress would be
very useful unless you're thinking of getting married
soon, but you could make it over and use it for
the foundation of an evening dress&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The other girl was carefully folding the white
satin skirt at the moment, but she stopped with it
in her arms and sat down weakly on the foot of the
bed with it all spread out in her lap and looked at
her guest in wonder:</p>

<p>"You don't mean you <i>wantta give it up!</i>" she
said in an awed tone. "You don't mean you would
be willing to take some of my old togs for it?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would!" cried Betty eagerly. "I
never want to see these things again! <i>I hate</i> them!
And besides, I want to get away somewhere. I can't
go in white satin! You know that! But I don't like
to take anything of yours that you might need. Do
you think these things would be worth anything
to you? You weren't thinking of getting married
yourself some time soon, were you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might," said the other girl, looking self-conscious.
"I got a gentleman friend. But I wasn't
expectin' to get in on any trooso like this!" She
let her finger move softly over the satin hem as if
she had been offered a plume of the angel's wing.
"Sure, I'll take it off you if I've got anything you're
satisfied to have in exchange. I wouldn't mind
havin' it to keep jest to look at now and then and
know it's mine. It'd be somethin' to live for, jest to
know you had that dress in the house!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Betty, without any warning even to
herself, dropped upon her knees beside the diminutive
bed and began to weep. It seemed somehow
so touching that a thing like a mere dress could make
a girl glad like that. All the troubles of the days
that were past went over her in a great wave of
agony, and overwhelmed her soul. In soft silk and
lace petticoat and camisole with her pretty white arms
and shoulders shaking with great sobs she buried
her face in the old patchwork quilt that her hostess
had brought from her village home, and gave way
to a grief that had been long in growing. The other
girl now thoroughly alarmed, laid the satin on a chair
and went over to the little stranger, gathering her
up in a strong embrace, and gradually lifting her to
the bed.</p>

<p>"You poor little Kid, you! I oughtta known
better! You're just all in! You ben gettin' ready
to be married, and something big's been troubling
you, and I bet they never gave you any lunch&mdash;er
else you wouldn't eat it,&mdash;and you're jest natcheraly
all in. Now you lie right here an' I'll make you
some supper. My name's Jane Carson, and I've got
a good mother out to Ohio, and a nice home if I'd
had sense enough to stay in it; only I got a chance
to make big money in a fact'ry. But I know what 'tis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to be lonesome, an' I ain't hard-hearted, if I do
know how to take care of misself. There! There!"</p>

<p>She smoothed back the lovely hair that curled
in golden tendrils where the tears had wet it.</p>

<p>"Say, now, you needn't be afraid! Nobody'll
getcha here! I know how to bluff 'em. Even if
a policeman should come after yeh, I'd get around
him somehow, and I don't care what you've done or
ain't done, I'll stand by yeh. I'm not one to turn
against anybody in distress. My mother always
taught me that. After you've et a bite and had a
cup of my nice tea with cream and sugar in it you'll
feel better, and we'll have a real chin-fest and hear
all about it. Now, you just shut your eyes and wait
till I make that tea."</p>

<p>Jane Carson thumped up the pillow scientifically
to make as many of the feathers as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'posible'">possible</ins> and
shifted the little flower-head upon it. Then she
hurried to her small washstand and took a little iron
contrivance from the drawer, fastening it on the
sickly gas-jet. She filled a tiny kettle with water
from a faucet in the hall and set it to boil. From
behind a curtain in a little box nailed to the wall she
drew a loaf of bread, a paper of tea and a sugar-bowl.
A cup and saucer and other dishes appeared from
a pasteboard box under the washstand. A small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
shelf outside the tiny window yielded a plate of butter,
a pint bottle of milk, and two eggs. She drew
a chair up to the bed, put a clean handkerchief on it,
and spread forth her table. In a few minutes the
fragrance of tea and toast pervaded the room,
and water was bubbling happily for the eggs. As
cosily as if she had a chum to dine with her she sat
down on the edge of the bed and invited her guest to
supper. As she poured the tea she wondered what
her co-laborers at the factory would think if they
knew she had a real society lady visiting her. It
wasn't every working girl that had a white satin
bride thrust upon her suddenly this way. It was
like a fairy story, having a strange bride lying on
her bed, and everything a perfect mystery about her.
She eyed the white silk ankles and dainty slippers
with satisfaction. Think of wearing underclothes
made of silk and real lace!</p>

<p>It seemed to Betty as if never before in all her
life had she tasted anything so delicious as that tea
and toast and soft boiled egg cooked by this wonderful
girl on a gaslight and served on a chair. She
wanted to cry again over her gladness at being here.
It didn't seem real after all the trouble she had
been through. It couldn't last! Oh, of course it
couldn't last!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>This thought came as she swallowed the last bite
of toast, and she sat up suddenly!</p>

<p>"I ought to be doing something quick!" she
said in sudden panic. "It is getting late and I must
get away. They'll be watching the trains, perhaps.
I ought to have gone at once. But I don't know
where I can go. Give me some old things, please.
I must get dressed at once."</p>

<p>"Lie down first and tell me who you are and
what it's all about. I can't do a thing for you till
I know. I've got to go into this with my eyes open or
I won't stir one step," she declared stubbornly.</p>

<p>Betty looked at her with wide eyes of trouble
and doubt. Then the doubt suddenly cleared away,
and trust broke through.</p>

<p>"I can trust you, I'm sure! You've been so
good to me! But it seems dreadful to tell things
about my family, even to one who has been so kind.
My father would be so hurt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your father? Where is your father? Why
didn't he take care of you and keep you from getting
into such big trouble, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes clouded with tears again.</p>

<p>"My father died five years ago," she said, "but
I've always tried to do as he would want to have
me do. Only&mdash;this&mdash;I <i>couldn't</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm!" said Jane Carson. "Then he prob'ly
wouldn't of wanted you to. Suppose you take the
rest of those togs off. I'll find you a warm nightgown
and we'll get to bed. It's turning cold here.
They take the heat off somewhere about six o'clock in
the evening, and it gets like ice up here sometimes."</p>

<p>Jane shivered and went to her small trunk, from
which she produced a coarse but clean flanellete nightgown,
and Betty, who had never worn anything
but a dainty lingerie one before in all her life, crept
into it thankfully and cuddled down with a warm
feeling that she had found a real friend. It was
curious why she did not shrink from this poor girl,
but she did not, and everything looked clean and nice.
Besides, this was a wonderful haven of refuge in her
dire necessity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, in the stately mansion that Betty
had called home, a small regiment of servants hastened
with the last tasks in preparation for the
guests that were soon expected to arrive. The great
rooms had become a dream of paradise, with silver
rain and white lilies in a mist of soft green depending
from the high ceilings. In the midst of all, a
fairy bower of roses and tropical ferns created a
nook of retirement where everyone might catch a
glimpse of the bride and groom from any angle in
any room. The spacious vistas stretched away from
an equally spacious hallway, where a wide and
graceful staircase curved up to a low gallery, smothered
in flowers and palms and vines; and even so
early the musicians were taking their places and tuning
their instruments. On the floor above, where
room after room shone in beauty, with costly furnishings,
and perfect harmonies, white-capped maids
flitted about, putting last touches to dressing tables
and pausing to gossip as they passed one another:</p>

<p>"Well, 'twill all be over soon," sighed one, a
wan-faced girl with discontented eyes. "Ain't it
kind of a pity, all this fuss just for a few minutes?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, an' glad I'll be!" declared another, a fresh
young Irish girl with a faint, pretty brogue. "I
don't like the look of my Lady Betty. A pretty fuss
Candace her old nurse would be makin' if she was
here the night! I guess the madam knew what she
was about when she give her her walkin' ticket!
Candace never could bear them two bys, and <i>him</i> was
the worse of the two, she always said."</p>

<p>"Well, a sight of good it would do for old
Candace to make a fuss!" said the discontented one.
"And anyhow, he's as handsome as the devil, and
she's got money enough, so she oughtn't complain."</p>

<p>"Money ain't everything!" sniffed Aileen. "I
wouldn't marry a king if I wasn't crazy about him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're young!" sneered Marie with disdain.
"Wait till your looks go! You don't know
what you'd take up with!"</p>

<p>"Well I'd never take up with the likes of <i>him!</i>"
returned the Irish girl grandly, "and what's more
he knows it!" She tossed her head meaningfully
and was about to sail away on her own business
when a stir below stairs attracted their attention.
A stout, elderly woman, dressed in a stiff new black
silk and an apoplectic hat, came panting up the
stairs looking furtively from side to side, as if she
wished to escape before anyone recognized her:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Candace!" exclaimed Aileen. "As I live!
Now what d'ye wantta know about that! Poor
soul! <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pood'">Poor</ins> soul! Candy! Oh!&mdash;Candy! What
iver brought ye here the night? This is no place for
the loikes of you. You better beat it while
the beatin' is good if ye know which side yer
bread's buthered!"</p>

<p>But the old nurse came puffing on, her face
red and excited:</p>

<p>"Is she here? Has she come, yet, my poor wee
Betty?" she besought them eagerly.</p>

<p>"Miss Betty's at the church now gettin' married!"
announced Marie uppishly, "and you'd best
be gettin' out of here right away, for the wedding
party's due to arrive any minute now and madam'll
be very angry to have a servant as doesn't belong
snoopin' round at such a time!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Marie! For shame!" cried Aileen.
"You've no need to talk like that to a self-respectin'
woman as has been in this house more years than
you have been weeks! Come along, Candace, and
I'll slip you in my room and tell you all about it
when I can get away long enough. You see, Miss
Betty's being married&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she's <i>not!</i>" cried Candace wildly. "I
was at the church myself. Miss Betty sent me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
word to be sure and come, and where to sit and all,
so she'd see me; and I went, and she come up the
aisle as white as a lily and dropped right there
before the poolpit, just like a little white lamb that
couldn't move another step, all of a heap in her
pretty things! And they stopped the ceremony and
everybody got up, and they took her away, and we
waited till bime-by the minister said the bride
wasn't well enough to proceed with the ceremony
and would they all go home, and I just slipped out
before the folks got their wraps on and took a
side street with wings to my feet and got up here!
Haven't they brought her home yet, the poor wee
thing? I been thinkin' they might need me yet,
for many's the time I've brought her round by
my nursin'."</p>

<p>The two maids looked wildly at one another,
their glances growing into incredulity, the eyebrows
of Marie moving toward her well-dressed hair with a
lofty disapproval.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better come with me, Candy," said
Aileen drawing the excited old servant along the
hall to the back corridor gently. "I guess there's
some mistake somewheres; anyway, you better stay
in my room till you see what happens. We haven't
heard anything yet, and they'd likely send word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pretty soon if there's to be any change in the program.
You say she fell&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But just then sounds of excitement came distantly
up to them and Aileen hastened back to the
gallery to listen. It was the voice of Madam Stanhope
angrily speaking to her youngest son:</p>

<p>"You must get Bessemer on the 'phone at once
and order him home! I told you it was a great mistake
sending him away. If he had been standing
there, where she could see him, everything would
have gone through just as we planned it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw! Rot! Mother. Can't you shut up? I
know what I'm about and I'm going to call up another
detective. Bessemer may go to the devil for
all I care! How do you know but he has, and taken
her with him? The first thing to do is to get that
girl back! You ought to have had more sense than to
show your whole hand to my brother. You might
have known he'd take advantage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herbert Hutton slammed into the telephone
booth under the stairs and Madam Stanhope was
almost immediately aware of the staring servants
who were trying not to seem to have listened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanhope stood in the midst of the beautiful
empty rooms and suddenly realized her position.
Her face froze into the haughty lines with which her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
menage was familiar, and she was as coldly beautiful
in her exquisite heliotrope gown of brocaded velvet
and chiffon with the glitter of jewels about her
smooth plump neck, and in her carefully marcelled
black hair as if she were quietly awaiting the bridal
party instead of facing defeat and mortification:</p>

<p>"Aileen, you may get Miss Betty's room ready
to receive her. She has been taken ill and will be
brought home as soon as she is able to be moved,"
she announced, without turning an eyelash. "Put
away her things, and get the bed ready!" One could
see that she was thinking rapidly. She was a woman
who had all her life been equal to an emergency, but
never had quite such a tragic emergency been thrust
upon her to camouflage before.</p>

<p>"James!" catching the eye of the butler, "there
will be no reception to-night, of course, and you
will see that the hired people take their things away
as soon as possible, and say that I will agree to
whatever arrangements they see fit to make, within
reason, of course. Just use your judgment, James,
and by the way, there will be telephone calls, of
course, from our friends. Say that Miss Betty is
somewhat better, and the doctor hopes to avert a
serious nervous breakdown, but that she needs entire
rest and absolute quiet for a few days. Say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and nothing more, do you understand, James?"</p>

<p>The butler bowed his thorough understanding
and Madam Stanhope sailed nobly up the flower-garlanded
staircase, past the huddled musicians, to
her own apartment. Aileen, with a frightened
glance, scuttled past the door as she was closing it:</p>

<p>"Aileen, ask Mr. Herbert to come to my room
at once when he has finished telephoning, and when
Mr. Bessemer arrives send him to me at once!"
Then the door closed and the woman was alone with
her defeat, and the placid enameled features melted
into an angry snarl like an animal at bay. In a
moment more Herbert stormed in.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault, mother!" he began, with
an oath. "If you hadn't dragged Bessemer into
this thing I'd have had her fixed. I had her just
about where I wanted her, and another day would
have broken her in. She's scared to death of insane
asylums, and I told her long ago that it would be
dead easy to put a woman in one for life. If I had
just hinted at such a thing she'd have married me
as meek as a lamb!"</p>

<p>"Now look here, Bertie," flared his mother
excitedly, "you've got to stop blaming me! Haven't
I given in to you all your life, and now you say
it's all my fault the least little thing that happens!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
It was for your sake that I stopped you; you know
it was. You couldn't carry out any such crazy
scheme. Betty's almost of age, and if those trustees
should find out what you had threatened, you would
be in jail for life, and goodness knows what would
become of me."</p>

<p>"Trustees! How would the trustees find it out?"</p>

<p>"Betty might tell them."</p>

<p>"Betty might <i>not</i> tell them, not if she was <i>my
wife!</i>" He bawled out the words in a way that
boded no blissful future to the one who should
have the misfortune to become his wife. "I think
I'd have her better trained than that. As for you,
Mother, you're all off, as usual! What do you
think could possibly happen to <i>you?</i> You're always
saying you do everything for me, but when it comes
right down to brass tacks I notice you're pretty much
of a selfish coward on your own account."</p>

<p>For a moment the baffled woman faced her angry
uncontrolled son in speechless rage, then gathered
command of the situation once more, an inscrutable
expression on her hard-lined face. Her voice took
on an almost pitiful reproach as she spoke in a
low, even tone that could hardly fail to bring the
instant attention of her spoiled son:</p>

<p>"Bertie, you don't know what you're talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
about!" she said, and there was a strained white
look of fear about her mouth and eyes as she spoke.
"I'm going to tell you, in this great crisis, what I
did for you, what I risked that you might enjoy
the luxury which you have had for the last five years.
Listen! The day before Mr. Stanhope died he
wrote a letter to the trustees of Betty's fortune giving
very explicit directions about her money and
her guardianship, tying things up so that not one
cent belonging to her should pass through my hands,
which would have left us with just my income as
the will provided, and would have meant comparative
poverty for us all except as Betty chose to be
benevolent. I kept a strict watch on all his movements
those last few days, of course, and when I
found he had given Candace a letter to mail, I told
her I would look after it, and I brought it up to my
room and read it, for I suspected just some such
thing as he had done. He was very fussy about
Betty and her rights, you remember, and he had
always insisted that this was Betty's house, her
mother's wedding present from the grandfather,
and therefore not ours at all, except through Betty's
bounty. I was determined that we should not be
turned out of here, and that you should not have
to go without the things you wanted while that child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had everything and far more than she needed. So
I burned the letter! Now, do you see what the
mother you have been blaming has done for you?"</p>

<p>But the son looked back with hard glittering eyes
and a sneer on his handsome lustful lips:</p>

<p>"I guess you did it about as much for your
own sake as mine, didn't you?" he snarled. "And
I don't see what that's got to do with it, anyway.
Those trustees don't know what they missed if they
never got the letter, and you've always kept in with
them, you say, and made them think you were crazy
about the girl. They pay you Betty's allowance till
she's of age, don't they? They can't lay a finger
on you. You're a fool to waste my time talking
about a little thing like that when we ought to be
planning a way to get hold of that girl before the
trustees find out about it. If we don't get her fixed
before she's of age we shall be in the soup as far as
the property is concerned. Isn't that so? Well, then,
we've got to get her good and married&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you only had let her marry Bessemer
quietly," whimpered his mother, "and not have
brought in all this deception. It will look so terrible
if it ever comes out. I shall never be able to hold
up my head in society again&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"There you are again! Thinking of yourself&mdash;&mdash;!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sneered the dutiful son, getting up and
stamping about her room like a wild man. "I tell
you, Mother, that girl is <i>mine</i>, and I won't have
Bessemer or anybody else putting in a finger. <i>She's
mine!</i> I told her so a long time ago, and she knows
it! She can't get away from me, and it's going to
go the harder with her because she's tried. I'm
never going to forgive her making a fool out of me
before all those people! I'll get her yet! Little fool!"</p>

<p>Herbert was well on his way into one of those fits
of uncontrollable fury that had always held his
mother in obedience to his slightest whim since the
days when he used to lie on the floor and scream
himself black in the face and hold his breath till she
gave in; and the poor woman, wrought to the highest
pitch of excitement already by the tragic events
of the evening, which were only the climax of long
weeks of agitation, anxiety and plotting, dropped
suddenly into her boudoir chair and began to weep.</p>

<p>But this new manifestation on the part of his
usually pliable mother only seemed to infuriate the
young man. He walked up to her, and seizing her
by the shoulder, shook her roughly:</p>

<p>"Cut that out!" he said hoarsely. "This is no
time to cry. We've got to make some kind of a plan.
Don't you see we'll have the hounds of the press at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
our heels in a few hours? Don't you see we've got
to make a plan and stick to it?"</p>

<p>His mother looked up, regardless for once of the
devastation those few tears had made of her carefully
groomed face, a new terror growing in
her eyes:</p>

<p>
"I've told James to answer all telephone calls and say that Betty is doing as
well as could be expected, <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">but that the
doctor says she must have perfect</span> quiet to save her from a nervous
breakdown&mdash;&mdash;" she answered him coldly. "I'm not quite a fool if you
do think so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right for to-night, but what'll
we say to-morrow if we don't find her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! She'll come back," said the stepmother
confidently. "She can't help it. Why, where would
she go? She hasn't a place on earth since she's lost
confidence in that cousin of her mother's because
he didn't come to her wedding. She hasn't an idea
that he never got her note asking him to give her
away. Thank heaven I got hold of that before it
reached the postman! If that old granny had been
here we should have had trouble indeed. I had an
experience with him once just before I married
Betty's father, and I never want to repeat it. But
we must look out what gets in the papers!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's rather late for that, I suspect. The bloodhounds
'ill be around before many minutes and you
better think up what you want said. But I'm not so
sure she wouldn't go there, and we better tell the
detectives that. What's the old guy's address? I'll
call him up long distance and say she was on a motoring
trip and intended to stop there if she had time.
I'll ask if she's reached there yet."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, although I'm sure she was
too hurt about it to go to him. She cried all the
afternoon. It's a wonder she didn't look frightful!
But that's Betty! Cry all day and come out looking
like a star without any paint either. It's a pity somebody
that would have appreciated it couldn't have
had her complexion."</p>

<p>"That's you all over, Mother, talking about
frivolous things when everything's happening at
once. You're the limit! I say, you'd better be getting
down to business! I've thought of another
thing. How about that old nurse, Candace? Betty
used to be crazy about her? What became of her?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanhope's face hardened, and anxiety grew
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"She might have gone to her, although I don't
believe she knows where she is. I'm sure I don't.
I sent her away just before we began to get ready for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the wedding. I didn't dare have her here. She
knows too much and takes too much upon herself.
I wouldn't have kept her so long, only she knew I
took the trustee's letter, and she was very impudent
about it once or twice, so that I didn't really dare
to let her go until just a few days ago. I thought
things would all be over here before she could do any
harm, and Betty would be of age and have her money
in her own right, and being your wife, of course there
wouldn't be any more trouble about it."</p>

<p>"Well, you better find out what's become of
her!" said the young man with darkening face. "<i>She</i>
ought to be locked up somewhere! She's liable to
make no end of trouble! You can't tell what she's
stirred up already! Ring for a servant and find out
if they know where she is. Ten to one that's where
Betty is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanhope, with startled face, stepped to the
bell and summoned Aileen:</p>

<p>"Aileen, have you any idea where we could find
Miss Betty's old nurse, Candace?" she asked in a
soothing tone, studying the maid's countenance. "I
think it might be well to send for her in case Miss
Betty needs her. She was so much attached to her!"</p>

<p>Aileen lifted startled eyes to her mistress' face.
There was reserve and suspicion in her glance:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, she was here a few minutes ago," she
said guardedly. "It seems Miss Betty sent her an
invitation, and when Miss Betty took sick she was
that scared she ran out of the church and come here
to find out how she was. She might not have gone
yet. I could go see."</p>

<p>"Here! Was she here?" Mrs. Stanhope turned
her head to her son and her eyes said: "That's
strange!" but she kept her face well under control.</p>

<p>"Yes, you might go and see if you can find her,
Aileen, and if you do, tell her I would like to see
her a moment."</p>

<p>Aileen went away on her errand and Mrs. Stanhope
turned to her son:</p>

<p>"Betty can't have gone to her unless there was
some collusion. But in any case I think we had
better keep her here until we know something."</p>

<p>Quick trotting steps were heard hurrying along
the hall and a little jerky knock announced unmistakably
the presence of Candace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanhope surveyed the little red-faced
creature coolly and sharply:</p>

<p>"Candace, you have broken one of my express
commands in returning here without permission from
me, but seeing it was done in kindness I will overlook
it this time and let you stay. You may be useful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
if they bring my daughter home to-night and I
presume she will be very glad to see you. Just now
she is&mdash;umm&mdash;&mdash;" she glanced furtively at her son,
and lifting her voice a trifle, as if to make her statement
more emphatic&mdash;"she is at a private hospital
near the church where they took her till she should
be able to come home. It will depend on her condition
whether they bring her to-night or to-morrow
or in a few days. Meantime, if you like you may go
up to your old room and wait until I send for you.
I shall have news soon and will let you know. Don't
go down to the servant's quarters, I wish to have you
where I can call you at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>Candace gave her ex-mistress a long, keen suspicious
stare, pinned her with a glance as steely as
her own for an instant, in search of a possible ulterior
motive, and then turning on her little fat heel,
vanished like a small fast racer in the direction of
her old room.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Stanhope, turning with a
sigh of relief, "she's safe! I'll set Marie to watch
her and if there's anything going on between those
two Marie will find it out."</p>

<p>But Herbert Hutton was already sitting at his
mother's desk with the telephone book and calling
up Long Distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>All the long hours when he had expected to have
been standing under the rose bower downstairs in
triumph with his bride, Herbert Hutton sat at that
telephone in his mother's boudoir alternately raging
at his mother and shouting futile messages over the
'phone. The ancient cousin of Betty's mother was
discovered to be seriously ill in a hospital and unable
to converse even through the medium of his
nurse, so there was nothing to be gained there.
Messages to the public functionaries in his town
developed no news. Late into the night, or rather
far toward the morning, Bessemer was discovered
at a cabaret where his persistent mother and brother
had traced him, too much befuddled with his evening's
carouse to talk connectedly. He declared
Betty was a good old girl, but she might go to
thunder for all he cared; he knew a girl "worth
twice of her."</p>

<p>His mother turned with disgust from his babbling
voice, convinced that he knew nothing of
Betty's whereabouts. Nevertheless, by means of a
financial system of threats and rewards which she
had used on him successfully for a number of years,
she succeeded in impressing upon him the necessity
of coming home at once, and just as the pink was
beginning to dawn in the gray of the morning, Bessemer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drove up in a hired car, and stumbled noisily
into the house, demanding to know where the wedding
was. He wanted to kiss the bride.</p>

<p>Candace, still in her stiff black silk, stood in the
shadowy hall, as near as she dared venture, and
listened, with her head thoughtfully on one side.
Betty in her note about the wedding had said she was
going to be married to Bessemer. But Bessemer
didn't sound like a bridegroom. Had Bessemer run
away then, or what? But some things looked queer.
She remembered that Aileen had spoken as if Herbert
was the bridegroom, but she had taken it for a
mere slip of the tongue and thought nothing of it.
When Aileen next came that way, she asked her if
she happened to have got hold of one of the invitations,
and Aileen, with her finger on her lips, nodded,
and presently returned with something under
her apron:</p>

<p>"I slipped it from the waste-basket," she said,
"and Miss Betty got a holt of it, and there was a
tremenjus fuss about something, I couldn't make
out what; but I heard the missus say it was all a mistake
as she gave the order over the 'phone, and she
must have misspoke herself, but anyhow she thought
she'd destroyed them all and given a rush order and
they would be all right and sent out in plenty of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
So she sticks this back in the waste-basket and orders
me to take the basket down and burn it, but I keeps
this out and hides it well. I couldn't see nothin' the
matter with it, can you?"</p>

<p>"There's <i>all</i> the matter with it!" declared the
angry nurse as she glared at the name of Herbert
Hutton thoughtfully, and read between the lines
more than she cared to tell.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> two miles away, Betty lay safe and warm in
the flanellette nightgown, and watched Jane Carson
turn out the light and open the window. A light
leaped up from the street and made a friendly spot
of brightness on the opposite wall, and Betty had a
sense of cosiness that she had not felt since she was
in boarding school with a roommate.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jane, climbing into bed and pulling
up the covers carefully lest she should let the cold in
on her guest, "let's hear!&mdash;You warm enough?"</p>

<p>There was a curious tenderness in her voice as if
she had brought home a young princess and must
guard her carefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly!" said Betty, giving a little nervous
shiver. "And I'm so glad to be here safe away
from them all! Oh, I've needed some one to advise
with <i>so</i> much! I haven't had a soul since they sent
my old nurse away because she dared to take my
part sometimes."</p>

<p>Suddenly Betty buried her face in the pillow and
began to sob and Jane reached out quick gentle arms
and gathered her in a close comforting embrace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
In a moment more Betty had gained control of herself
and began to explain:</p>

<p>"You see," she said, catching her breath bravely,
"they were determined I should marry a man I
can't <i>endure</i>, and when I wouldn't they tried to <i>trick</i>
me into it anyway. I never suspected until I got
into the church and looked around and couldn't see
Bessemer anywhere; only the other one with his
evil eyes gloating over me, and then I knew! They
thought they would get me there before all that
church full of people and I wouldn't dare do anything.
But when I realized it, I just dropped right
down in the aisle. I couldn't stand up, I was
so frightened."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said Jane. "Were
there <i>two</i> men?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," sighed Betty, "there were two."</p>

<p>"Well, where was the other one, the one you
<i>wanted</i> to marry?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;&mdash;" said Betty with a half sob
in her voice. "That's just what frightened me.
You see they were my stepmother's two sons,
and it was my father's dying wish that I should
marry one of them. I didn't really <i>want</i> to
marry Bessemer, but I simply <i>loathed</i> Herbert,
the younger one, who was so determined to marry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
me. I was terribly afraid of him. He had been
frightfully cruel to me when I was a child and when
he grew up he was always tormenting me; and then
when he tried to make love to me he was so repulsive
that I couldn't bear to look at him. It really made
me sick to think of ever marrying him. Oh&mdash;I
<i>couldn't</i>&mdash;no matter who asked me. So Bessemer
and I decided to get married to stop the trouble.
They were always nagging him, too, and I was kind
of sorry for him."</p>

<p>"But why should you marry anybody you didn't
want to, I'd like to know!" exclaimed Jane in horror.
"This is a free country and nobody ever makes
people marry anybody they don't like any more.
Why didn't you just beat it?"</p>

<p>"I thought about that a good many times," said
Betty, pressing her tired eyes with her cold little
fingers, "but I couldn't quite bring myself to do it.
In the first place, I didn't know where to go, nor
what to do. They never would let me learn to do
anything useful, so I couldn't have got any work;
and anyhow I had a feeling that it wouldn't be possible
to get away where Herbert couldn't find me if
he wanted to. He's that way. He always gets what
he wants, no matter whom it hurts. He's <i>awful</i>&mdash;Jane&mdash;really!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pitiful note in her voice that appealed
to the mother in Jane, and she stooped over her guest
and patted her comfortingly on the shoulder:</p>

<p>"You poor little kid," she said tenderly, "you
must have been worried something awful, but still I
don't get you; what was the idea in sticking around
and thinking you <i>had</i> to marry somebody you didn't
like? You coulda gone to some one and claimed
pertection. You could uv appealed to the p'lice if
worst came to worst&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Oh! But Jane I couldn't! That would have
brought our family into disgrace, and father would
have felt so <i>dreadfully</i> about it if he had been alive!
I couldn't quite bring myself, either, to go against
his dying request. We had always been so much
to each other, Daddy and I. Besides, I didn't mind
<i>Bessemer</i> so <i>much</i>&mdash;he was always kind&mdash;though we
never had much to do with each other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think I'd have stopped around
long to please a father that didn't care any more for
me than to want me to marry somebody I felt that
way about!" said Jane, indignantly. "I haven't
much use for a father like that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but he wasn't like that!" said Betty, rising
up in her eagerness and looking at Jane through
her shining curls that were falling all about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
eager, troubled young face, "and he did love me,
Jane, he loved me better than anything else in the
whole world! That was why I was willing to sacrifice
almost anything to please him."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned!" said Jane Carson, sitting
up squarely in bed and staring at the spot of
light on the wall. "That gets my goat! How could
a man love you and yet want to torment you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Jane, he hadn't been very fond
of them when they were boys"&mdash;she spoke it with
dignity and a little gasp as if she were committing
a breach of loyalty to explain, but realized that it was
necessary&mdash;"and he felt when he was dying that
he wanted to make reparation, so he thought if
I should marry one of them it would show them that
he had forgiven them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;may&mdash;be&mdash;so," drawled Jane slowly, nodding
her head deliberately with each word, "but&mdash;I
don't see it that <i>way!</i> What kind of a man was this
father of yours, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a wonderful man, Jane!" Betty eagerly
hastened to explain. "He was all the world to me,
and he used to come up to school week-ends and
take me on beautiful trips and we had the best times
together, and he would tell me about my own
dear mother&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty's hand grasped Jane's convulsively and
her voice died out, in a sudden sob. Jane's hand
went quickly to the bright head on the pillow:</p>

<p>"There! there!" she whispered tenderly, "don't
take on so, I didn't mean anything. I was just trying
to dope it out; get it through my bean what in
thunder&mdash;&mdash;! Say! Did <i>he</i> <span class="smcap">tell</span> <i>you</i> he wanted
you to marry those guys?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he left word&mdash;it was his dying
request."</p>

<p>"Who'd he request it to?"</p>

<p>"My stepmother."</p>

<p>"H'm! I thought so! How'd you know he
did? How'd you know but she was lyin'?"</p>

<p>"No," said Betty sorrowfully, "she wasn't lying,
she showed me the paper it was written on. There
couldn't be any mistake. And his name was signed
to it, his dear hand-writing, just as he always wrote
it with the little quirl to the S that wasn't like anybody
else. It went through me just like a knife
when I saw it, that my dear father should have asked
me to do what was so very very hard for me to think
of. It was so much harder to have it come that way.
If he had only asked me himself and we could have
talked it over, perhaps he would have helped me to
be strong enough to do it, but to have <i>her</i> have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<i>tell me!</i> She felt that herself. She tried to be kind,
I think. She said she wanted to have him wake me
up and tell me himself, but she saw his strength
was going and he was so anxious to have her write
it down quick and let him sign it that she did as
he asked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you may depend on it he never wrote
it at all&mdash;or anyhow, never knew what he was signing.
Like as not she dragged it out of him some
way while he was out of his mind or so near dying
he didn't know what he was about. Besides, they
mightta some of 'em forged his name. It's easy to
copy signatures. Lotsa people do it real good. If
I was you I wouldn't think another mite about it. If
he was a man like you say he is, he couldn'ta done
a thing like that to his own little girl, not on his life!
It ain't like real fathers and mothers to. I know, fer
I've got a mother that's a peach and no mistake!
No, you may depend on it, he never knew a thing
about that, and marrying a guy like that is the last
thing on earth he'd want you to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really think so? Oh, are you
<i>sure?</i>" cried Betty, clinging to Jane eagerly, the
tears raining down her white cheeks. "I've thought
so a thousand times, but I didn't dare trust myself
to decide."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure!" said Jane, gathering her in her
arms and hugging her tight, just as she would have
done with a little sister who had waked up in the
night with a bad dream. "Now, look here, you
stop crying and don't you worry another bit. Just
tell me the rest if there's any rest, so I'll know what
to bank on. Who is the other guy, the one you didn't
mind marryin'? What became of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the queer part," said Betty,
troubled again. "He didn't seem to be anywhere,
and when they carried me into the room back of the
church and fanned me and got water to bathe my
face, a doctor came and gave me some medicine and
sent them all out, and I asked him to send Bessemer
to me. I wanted to find out why he hadn't been
standing up there by the minister the way I expected.
I heard the doctor go out and ask for Bessemer
and I heard my stepmother's voice say, 'Why Bessemer
isn't here! He's gone down to the shore!'
and then somebody said, 'Hush,' and they shut the
door, and I was so frightened that I got up and
tried all the doors till I found one that led down
some stairs, and I locked it behind me and ran and
found you!"</p>

<p>"You poor little kid!" cried Jane, cuddling her
again. "I sure am glad I was on the job! But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
now, tell me, what's your idea? Will they make a
big noise and come huntin' you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Betty wearily. "I suppose they
will. I <i>know</i> they will, in fact. Herbert won't be
balked in anything he wants&mdash;&mdash;Bessemer won't
count. He never counts. I'm sort of sorry for him,
though I don't like him much. You see they had
been making an awful fuss with him, too, about
some actress down at the shore that he was sending
flowers to, and I knew he didn't have a very easy
time. So when he came in one day and asked me
why I didn't marry <i>him</i> and settle the whole thing
that way, I was horrified at first, but I finally
thought perhaps that would be the best thing to do.
He said he wouldn't bother me any, if I wouldn't
bother him; and we thought perhaps the others would
let us alone then. But I might have known Herbert
wouldn't give in! Bessemer is easily led&mdash;Herbert
could have hired him to go away to-night&mdash;or they
may have <i>made</i> him ask me to marry him. He's
like that," sadly. "You can't depend on him. I
don't know. You see, it was kind of queer about
the invitations. They came with Herbert's name in
them first, and my stepmother tried to keep me
from seeing them. She said they were late and she
had them all sent off; but I found one, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I went to my stepmother with it she said it was a
mistake. She hadn't meant me to be annoyed by
seeing it; and she didn't know how it happened; she
must have misspoken herself&mdash;but it had been corrected
and they would rush it through and send them
right from the store this time so there wouldn't
be any delay. I tried to think it was all right, but
it troubled me, for I saw that Herbert hadn't given
up at all&mdash;though he pretended to go away, and I
hoped I wouldn't have any more trouble&mdash;but I
might have known! Herbert never gave up anything
in his life, not even when father was living.
He always managed to get his way, somehow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he love you so much?" Jane asked
awesomely.</p>

<p>Betty shuddered:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know whether it was love or hate!
It was all the same. I hate to think about him&mdash;he
is&mdash;<i>unbearable</i>, Jane! Why, Jane, once he told me
if he ever got me in his power he'd break my will
or kill me in the attempt!"</p>

<p>"Well, now, there, Kid! Don't you think another
bit about him, the old brute! You just lie
down and sleep as easy as if you was miles away.
They won't any of 'em ever find you here with me,
and I've pulled the washstand in front of the door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
so you needn't be dreaming of anybody coming in
and finding you. Now go to sleep, and to-morrow
I'll sneak you away to a place where they can't ever
find you. Good night, Kid!" and Jane leaned down
and kissed the soft hair on the pillow beside her.
Betty flung her arms about her new-found friend
and kissed her tenderly:</p>

<p>"Oh, you've been so good to me! What should
I ever have done if I hadn't found you. You were
like an angel. I think surely God must have sent
you to help me."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if he did!" said Jane
thoughtfully. "An angel in a mackintosh!
Some angel!"</p>

<p>Jane Carson with her eyes wide open lay staring
into the darkness and thinking it all over. She did
not waste much time marvelling over the wonder that
it had all happened to her. That would do for
afterward when there was nothing else to be done
about it. Now there must be some plans made and
she was the one to make them. It was quite plain
that the wonderful and beautiful Elizabeth Stanhope,
the plans for whose wedding had been blazoned in
the papers for days beforehand, was not at present
capable of making or carrying out anything effective.
Jane was. She knew it. She was a born leader and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
promoter. She liked nothing better than to work
out a difficult situation. But this was the most difficult
proposition that she had ever come up against.
When her father died and her mother was left with
the little house and the three younger children to
support in a small country village, and only plain
sewing and now and then a boarder to eke out a living
for them all, she had sought and found, through
a summer visitor who had taught her Sunday school
class for a few weeks, a good position in this big
Eastern city. She had made good and been promoted
until her wages not only kept herself with strict
economy, but justified her in looking forward to the
time when she might send for her next younger sister.
Her deft fingers kept her meagre wardrobe in
neatness&mdash;and a tolerable deference to fashion, so
that she had been able to annex the "gentleman
friend" and take a little outing with him now and
then at a moving picture theatre or a Sunday evening
service. She had met and vanquished the devil on
more than one battlefield in the course of her experience
with different department heads; and she was
wise beyond her years in the ways of the world.
But this situation was different. Here was a girl
who had been brought up "by hand," as she would
have said with a sneer a few hours before, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would have despised her for it. She raised up on
one elbow and leaned over once more to watch the
delicate profile of this gentle maiden, in the dim fitful
light of the city night that came through the one little
window. There had been something appealing in the
beauty and frankness of the girl bride, something
appalling in the situation she had found herself in.
Jane Carson didn't know whether she was doing
right or not to help this stray bride. It made her
catch her breath to think how she might be bringing
all the power of the law and of money upon her reckless
young head, but she meant to do it, just the same.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Stanhope! What a beautiful name!
It fitted right in with all the romance Jane had ever
dreamed. If she only could write scenarios, what a
thriller this would make!</p>

<p>Then she lay down and fell to planning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned, and still no word from
the missing bride. But the brief guarded sentences
which Herbert Hutton had telephoned to the newspapers
had been somehow sidetracked, and in their
place a ghastly story had leaked out which some
poor, hard-pressed reporter had gleaned from the
gossip in the church and hurried off to put into type
before there was time for it to be denied. Hot foot
the story had run, and great headlines proclaimed
the escape of Betty even while the family were carefully
paving the way for the report of a protracted
illness and absence, if need be, till they could find
trace of her. The sun rose brightly and made weird
gleaming of the silver wire on which the dying roses
hung. The air was heavy with their breath, and the
rooms in the early garish light looked out of place as
if some fairy wand had failed to break the incantation
at the right hour and left a piece of Magicland
behind. The parlor maid went about uncertainly,
scarcely knowing what to do and what to leave
undone, and the milk cars, and newsboys, and early
laborers began to make a clatter of every day on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
streets. The morning paper, flung across the steps
with Betty's picture, where Betty's reluctant feet
had gone a few hours before, seemed to mock at
life, and upstairs the man that Betty thought she
went out to marry, lay in a heavy stupor of sleep.
Happy Betty, to be resting beneath the coarse sheet
of the kindly working girl, sleeping the sleep of exhaustion
and youth in safety, two miles from the
rose-bowered rooms!</p>

<p>Long before day had really started in the great
city Jane Carson was up and at work. She dressed
swiftly and silently, then went to her little trunk,
and from it selected a simple wardrobe of coarse
clean garments. One needed mending and two buttons
were off. She sat by the dingy window and
strained her eyes in the dawn to make the necessary
repairs. She hesitated long over the pasteboard
suit-box that she drew from under the bed. It
contained a new dark blue serge dress for which she
had saved a long time and in which she had intended
to appear at church next Sabbath. She was divided
between her desire to robe the exquisite little guest
in its pristine folds and her longing to wear it herself.
There was a sense of justice also which entered into
the matter. If that elegant wedding dress was to be
hers, and all those wonderful silk underclothes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which very likely she would never allow herself
to wear, for they would be out of place on a poor
working girl, it was not fair to repay their donor in
old clothes. She decided to give the runaway bride
her new blue serge. With just a regretful bit of a
sigh she laid it out on the foot of the bed, and
carefully spread out the tissue papers and folded the
white satin garments away out of sight, finishing the
bundle with a thick wrapping of old newspapers from
a pile behind the door and tying it securely. She
added a few pins to make the matter more sure,
and got out a stub of a pencil and labeled it in large
letters, "My summer dresses," then shoved it far
back under the bed. If any seeking detective came
he would not be likely to bother with that, and he
might search her trunk in vain for white satin
slippers and wedding veils.</p>

<p>Breakfast was next, and she put on her cloak and
hurried out for supplies for the larder had been
heavily depleted the night before to provide for her
guest. With a tender glance toward the sleeper she
slipped the key from the lock and placed it in the
outside of the door, silently locking her guest within.
Now there would be no danger of any one spiriting
her away while she was gone, and no danger that the
girl might wake up and depart in her absence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped a newsboy on his way to the subway
and bought a paper, thrilling at the thought that
there might be something in it about the girl who lay
asleep in her little hall bedroom.</p>

<p>While she waited for her bundles she stole a
glance at her paper, and there on the front page in big
letters ran the heading:</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Stanhope Wedding<br />
Held Up at Altar by<br />
Unconscious Bride</span><br />
<br />
<i>Relatives Seek Runaway Girl Who is<br />
Thought to be Insane</i><br />
</div>

<p>She caught her breath and rolled the paper in a
little wad, stuffing it carelessly into her pocket. She
could not read any more of that in public. She
hastened back to her room.</p>

<p>Betty was still sleeping. Jane stood watching
her for a full minute with awe in her face. She
could not but recognize the difference between herself
and this fine sweet product of civilization and
wealth. With the gold curls tossed back like a
ripple of sunshine, and a pathetic little droop at the
corners of her sweet mouth, nothing lovelier could
be. Jane hurried to the window and turned her
back on the bed while she perused the paper, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
rage rising at the theories put forth. It was even
hinted that her mother had been insane. Jane turned
again and looked hard at the young sleeper, and the
idea crossed her mind that even she might be deceived.
Still, she was willing to trust her judgment
that this girl was entirely sane, and anyhow she
meant to help her! She stuffed the paper down
behind the trunk and began to get breakfast. When
it was almost ready she gently awoke the sleeper.</p>

<p>Betty started at the light touch on her shoulder
and looked wildly around at the strange room and
stranger face of the other girl. In the dim light of
the evening she had scarcely got to know Jane's face.
But in a moment all the happenings of the day before
came back, and she sat up excitedly.</p>

<p>"I ought to have got away before it was light,"
she said gripping her hands together. "I wonder
where I could go, Jane?" It was pleasant to call
this girl by her first name. Betty felt that she was a
tower of strength, and so kind.</p>

<p>"I have this ring," she said, slipping off an exquisite
diamond and holding it out. "Do you suppose
there would be any way I could get money
enough to travel somewhere with this? If I can't
I'll have to walk, and I can't get far in a day
that way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty was almost light-hearted, and smiling. The
night had passed and no one had come. Perhaps
after all she was going to get away without
being stopped.</p>

<p>Jane's face set grimly.</p>

<p>"I guess there won't be any walking for you.
You'll have to travel regular. It wouldn't be safe.
And you don't want no rich jewelry along either.
Was that your wedding ring?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; father gave it to me. It was mother's,
but I guess they'd want me to use it now. I haven't
anything else."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jane shortly to hide the emotion
in her voice. "Now eat this while I talk,"
thrusting a plate of buttered toast and a glass of
orange marmalade at her, and hastening to pour an
inviting cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"Now, I been thinking," she said sitting down
on the edge of the bed and eating bits of the piece
of toast she had burned&mdash;Betty's was toasted beautifully&mdash;"I
got a plan. I think you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'beter'">better</ins> go to Ma.
She's got room enough for you for a while, and I
want my sister to come over and take a place I can
get fer her. If you was there she could leave. Mebbe
you could help Ma with the kids. Of course we're
poor and you ain't used to common things like we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have them, but I guess you ain't got much
choice in your fix. I got a paper this morning.
They're huntin' fer you hot foot. They say you
was temperary insane, an' 'f I was you I'd keep out
o' their way a while. You lay low an' I'll keep my eye
out and let you know, I've got a little money under
the mattrass I can let you have till that ring gets sold.
You can leave it with me an' I'll do the best I can
if you think you can trust me. Of course I'm a
stranger, but then, land! So are you! We just
<i>gotta</i> trust each other. And I'm sending you to my
mother if you'll go!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Betty, springing up and hugging her
impulsively, "you're so good! To think I should
find somebody just like that right in the street when
I needed you so. I almost think God did it!"</p>

<p>"Well, mebbe!" said Jane, in her embarrassment
turning to hang up a skirt that had fallen from
its hook. "That's what they say sometimes in
Chrishun Deavor meetin'. Ever go to Chrishun
Deavor? Better go when you get out home. They
have awful good socials an' ice cream, and you'll
meet some real nice folks. We've got a peach of a
minister, and his wife is perfec'ly dandy. I tell you
I missed 'em when I came to the city! They was
always doing something nice fer the young folks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"How interesting!" said Betty, wondering if she
might really be going to live like other girls. Then
the shadow of her danger fell over her once more,
and her cheek paled.</p>

<p>"If I can only get there safely," she shuddered.
"Oh, Jane! You can't understand what it would
be to have to go back!"</p>

<p>"Well, you're not going back. You're going to
Tinsdale, and nobody's going to find you ever, unless
you want 'em to! See? Now, listen! We haven't
any time to waste. You oughtta get off on the ten
o'clock train. I put out some clothes there for yeh.
They ain't like yours, but it won't do fer you to go
dressed like a millionairess. Folks out to Tinsdale
would suspect yeh right off the bat. You gotta go
plain like me, and it's this way: You're a friend I
picked up in the city whose mother is dead and you
need country air a while, see? So I sent you home to
stay with Ma till you got strong again. I'm wirin'
Ma. She'll understand. She always does. I kinda
run Ma anyhow. She thinks the sun rises an' sets
in me, so she'll do just what I say."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I oughtn't to intrude," said Betty
soberly, taking up the coarse, elaborately trimmed
lingerie with a curious look, and trying not to seem
to notice that it was different from any she had
ever worn before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say! Looka here!" said Jane Carson, facing
round from her coffee cup on the washstand. "I'm
sorry to criticize, but if you could just talk a little
slang or something. Folks'll never think you belong
to me. <i>'Intrude!'</i> Now, that sounds stuck up! You
oughtta say 'be in the way,' or something natural
like that. See?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't," said Betty dubiously, "but
I'll try."</p>

<p>"You're all right, Kid," said Jane with compunction
in her voice. "Just let yourself down a little
like I do, and remember you don't wear silk onderclothes
now. I'm afraid those stockings won't feel
very good after yours, but you gotta be careful. An'
'f I was you I'd cut my hair off, I really would. It's
an awful pity, it's so pretty, but it'll grow again.
How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Almost twenty-one," said Betty thoughtfully.
"Just three months more and I'll be twenty-one."</p>

<p>"H'm! Of age!" said Jane with a sharp significant
look at her, as if a new thought had occurred.
"Well, you don't look it! You could pass for fifteen,
especially if you had your hair bobbed. I can
do it for you if you say so."</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty promptly without a
qualm. "I always wanted it short. It's an awful
nuisance to comb."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the talk!" said Jane. "Say 'awful' a
lot, and you'll kinda get into the hang of it. It
sounds more&mdash;well, <i>natural</i>, you know; not like society
talk. Here, sit down and I'll do it quick before
you get cold feet. I sure do hate to drop them curls,
but I guess it's best."</p>

<p>The scissors snipped, snipped, and the lovely
strands of bright hair fell on the paper Jane had
spread for them. Betty sat cropped like a sweet
young boy. Jane stood back and surveyed the effect
through her lashes approvingly. She knew the exact
angle at which the hair should splash out on the cheek
to be stylish. She had often contemplated cutting
her own, only that her mother had begged her not to,
and she realized that her hair was straight as a die
and would never submit to being tortured into that
alluring wave over the ear and out toward the cheekbone.
But this sweet young thing was a darling!
She felt that the daring deed had been a success.</p>

<p>"I got a bottle of stuff to make your hair dark,"
she remarked. "I guess we better put it on. That
hair of yours is kinda conspicuous, you know, even
when it's cut off. It won't do you any harm. It
washes off soon." And she dashed something on the
yellow hair. Betty sat with closed eyes and submitted.
Then her mentor burnt a cork and put a
touch to the eyebrows that made a different Betty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
out of her. A soft smudge of dark under her eyes
and a touch of talcum powder gave her a sickly
complexion and when Betty stood up and looked in
the glass she did not know herself. Jane finished
the toilet by a smart though somewhat shabby black
hat pulled well down over Betty's eyes, and a pair
of gray cotton gloves, somewhat worn at the fingers.
The high-laced boots she put upon the girl's feet
were two sizes too large, and wobbled frightfully,
but they did well enough, and there seemed nothing
more to be desired.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jane as she pinned on her own hat,
"you've gotta have a name to go by. I guess you
better be Lizzie Hope. It kinda belongs to yeh, and
yet nobody'd recognize it. You don't need to tell
Ma anything you don't want to, and you can tell
her I'll write a letter to-night all about it. Now come
on! We gotta go on the trolley a piece. I don't
see havin' you leave from the General Station. We'll
go up to the Junction and get the train there."</p>

<p>With an odd feeling that she was bidding
good-by to herself forever and was about to become
somebody else, Betty gave one more glance at the
slim boylike creature in the little mirror over the
washstand and followed Jane out of the room, shuffling
along in the big high-heeled boots, quite unlike
the Betty that she was.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Warren Reyburn</span> laid down his pen and shoved
back his office chair impatiently, stretching out his
long muscular limbs nervously and rubbing his
hands over his eyes as if to clear them from annoying
visions.</p>

<p>James Ryan, his office boy and stenographer,
watched him furtively from one corner of his eye,
while his fingers whirled the typewriter on through
the letter he was typing. James wanted to take
his girl to the movies that evening and he hadn't
had a chance to see her the day before. He was
wondering if Mr. Reyburn would go out in time for
him to call her up at her noon hour. He was a very
temperamental stenographer and understood the
moods and tenses of his most temperamental employer
fully. It was all in knowing how to manage
him. James was most deferential, and knew when
to keep still and not ask questions. This was one
of the mornings when he went to the dictionary
himself when he wasn't sure of a word rather than
break the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ominious'">ominous</ins> silence. Not that Mr. Reyburn
was a hard master, quite the contrary, but this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
James's first place straight from his brief course at
business school, and he was making a big bluff of
being an old experienced hand.</p>

<p>There was not much business to be done. This
was Warren Reyburn's "first place" also in the
world of business since finishing his law course, and
he was making a big bluff at being very busy, to cover
up a sore heart and an anxious mind. It was being
borne in upon him gradually that he was not a shouting
success in business so far. The rosy dreams that
had floated near all through his days of hard study
had one by one left him, until his path was now leading
through a murky gray way with little hope ahead.
Nothing but sheer grit kept him at it, and he began
to wonder how long he could stick it out if nothing
turned up.</p>

<p>True, he might have accepted an offer that even
now lay open on his desk; a tempting offer, too, from
a big corporation who recognized the influence of his
old family upon their particular line of business;
but it was a line that his father and his grandfather
had scorned to touch, and he had grown up with
an honest contempt for it. He just could not bring
himself to wrest the living from the poor and needy,
and plunder the unsuspecting, and he knew that was
what it would be if he closed with this offer. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
yet had he been reduced to such depths, he told himself,
shutting his fine lips in a firm curve. "No, not
if he starved!"</p>

<p>That was the legitimate worry that ruffled his
handsome brow as he sat before his desk frowning
at that letter. He meant to begin dictation on its
answer in another five minutes or so, but meantime
he was forcing himself to go over every point and
make it strong and clear to himself, so that he should
say, "No!" strongly and clearly to the corporation.
It might do harm to make his reason for declining
so plain, but he owed it to his self-respect to give
it nevertheless, and he meant to do so. After all,
he had no business so far to harm, so what did it
matter? If nothing turned up pretty soon to give
him a start he would have to change his whole plan
of life and take up something else where one did not
have to wait for a reputation before he could have
a chance to show what was in him.</p>

<p>But underneath the legitimate reason for his
annoyance this morning there ran a most foolish little
fretting, a haunting discomfort.</p>

<p>He had taken his cousin to a wedding the night
before because her husband had been called away
on business, and she had no one to escort her. They
had been late and the church was crowded. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had to stand, and as he idly looked over the audience
he suddenly looked full into the great sad eyes of the
sweetest little bride he had ever seen. He had not
been a young man to spend his time over pretty faces,
although there were one or two nice girls in whom
he was mildly interested. He had even gone so far
as to wonder now and then which of them he would
be willing to see sitting at his table day after day
the rest of his life, and he had not yet come to a satisfactory
conclusion. His cousin often rallied him
about getting married, but he always told her it
would be time enough to think about that when he
had an income to offer her.</p>

<p>But when he saw that flower-face, his attention
was held at once. Somehow he felt as if he had
not known there was a face like that in all the world,
so like a child's, with frank yet modest droop to the
head, and the simplicity of an angel, yet the sadness
of a sacrificial offering. Unbidden, a great desire
sprang up to lift for her whatever burden she was
bearing, and bring light into those sad eyes. Of
course it was a passing sensation, but his eyes had
traveled involuntarily to the front of the church to
inspect the handsome forbidding face of the bridegroom,
and with instant dissatisfaction he looked
back to the girl once more and watched her come up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to the altar, speculating as those who love to study
humanity are wont to do when they find an interesting
subject. How had those two types ever happened
to come together? The man's part in it was plain.
He was the kind who go about seeking whom they
may devour, thought Warren Reyburn. But the
woman! How could a wise-eyed child like that
have been deceived by a handsome face? Well, it
was all speculation of course, and he had nothing
to do with any of them. They were strangers to him
and probably always would be. But he had no conception
at that time what a small world he lived in,
nor how near the big experiences of life lie all
about us.</p>

<p>He watched the lovely bride as all the audience
watched her until he saw her fall, and then he
started forward without in the least realizing what
he was doing. He found himself half way up the
side aisle to the altar before he came to himself and
forced his feet back to where his cousin was sitting.
Of course he had no right up there, and what could
he do when there were so many of her friends and
relatives about her?</p>

<p>His position near the side door through which
they carried her made it quite possible for him to
look down into her still face as they took her to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
vestry room, and he found a great satisfaction in
seeing that she was even more beautiful at close
hand than at a distance. He wondered afterward
why his mind had laid so much stress upon the fact
that her skin was lovely like a baby's without any
sign of cosmetics. He told himself that it was
merely his delight to learn that there was such a
type, and that it ran true.</p>

<p>He was therefore not a little disappointed that
the minister, after the congregation had waited an
unconscionable time for the return of the bride, came
out and announced that owing to her continued collapse
the ceremony would have to be postponed. The
clatter of polite wonder and gossip annoyed him beyond
measure, and he was actually cross with his
cousin on the way home when she ranted on about
the way girls nowadays were brought up, coddled,
so that a breath would blow them away. Somehow
she had not looked like that kind of a girl.</p>

<p>But when the morning papers came out with sensational
headlines proclaiming that the bride had
run away, and suggesting all sorts of unpleasant
things about her, he felt a secret exultation that she
had been brave enough to do so. It was as if he
had found that her spirit was as wise and beautiful
as her face had been. His interest in the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
exceeded all common sense and he was annoyed and
impatient with himself more than he cared to own.
Never before had a face lured his thoughts like this
one. He told himself that his business was getting
on his nerves, and that as soon as he could be sure
about one or two little matters that he hoped would
fall into his hands to transact, he would take a few
days off and run down to the shore.</p>

<p>Again and again the little white bride came
across his vision and thoughts, and hindered the
courteous but stinging phrases with which he had
intended to illumine his letter. At last he gave it
up and taking his hat went out in the keen November
air for a walk to clear his brain.</p>

<p>This was James Ryan's opportunity. It was
almost twelve o'clock and no harm in calling the
"forelady" in the cotton blouse department of the
big factory. He swung to the telephone with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I want to speak with Miss Carson, please.
Yes, Miss J. Carson. Is that Miss Carson? Oh,
hello, Jane, is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is <i>Mister</i> Ryan," answered Jane sweetly.</p>

<p>"Jane!"</p>

<p>"Well, didn't you 'Miss Carson' me?"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Jane. You win. Say, Jane!"</p>

<p>"Well, Jimmie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's my girl, say how about that wedding
veil? Been thinking any more about it?"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then a conscious
giggle, the full significance of which James Ryan
was not in a position to figure out.</p>

<p>"Say, Jimmie, quit your kiddin'! You mustn't
say things like that over the 'phone."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"'Cause. Folks might listen."</p>

<p>"I should worry! Well, since you say so. How
about seein' a show together to-night?"</p>

<p>"Fine an' dandy, Jimmie! I'll be ready at the
usual time. I gotta go now, the boss is comin'. So
long, Jimmie!"</p>

<p>"So long, darling!"</p>

<p>But the receiver at the other end hung up with
a click, while Jane with a smile on her lips thought
of the pasteboard box under her bed and wondered
what Jimmie would say if he could know. For Jane
had fully made up her mind that Jimmie was not to
know. Not at present, anyhow. Some time she might
tell him if things turned out all right, but she knew
just what lordly masculine advice and criticism
would lie upon James Ryan's lips if she attempted
to tell him about her strange and wonderful guest
of the night before. Maybe she was a fool to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
trusted a stranger that way. Maybe the girl would
turn out to be insane or wrong somehow, and trouble
come, but she didn't believe it; and anyhow, she
was going to wait, until she saw what happened next
before she got Jimmie mixed up in it. Besides, the
secret wasn't hers to tell. She had promised Betty,
and she always kept her promises. That was one
reason why she was so slow in promising to think
about a wedding veil in response to James Ryan's oft
repeated question.</p>

<p>That evening on the way to the movies Jane
instituted an investigation.</p>

<p>"Jimmie, what kind of a man is your boss?"</p>

<p>"White man!" said Jimmie promptly.</p>

<p>"Aw! Cut it out, James Ryan! I don't mean
how'd s'e look, or what color is he; I mean what
kind of a <i>man</i> is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's the answer. White man! What's
the matter of that? I said it and I meant it. He's
white if there ever was one!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" said Miss Carson in scorn. "Of
course I know he's a peach. If he wasn't you
wouldn't be workin' for him. What I mean, is he
a <i>snob?</i>"</p>

<p>"No chance!"</p>

<p>"Well, I saw him <i>with</i> 'em last night. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
passin' that big church up Spruce Street and I saw
him standin' with his arms folded so&mdash;&mdash;" she paused
on the sidewalk and indicated his pose. "It was a
swell weddin' and the place was full up. He had a
big white front an' a clawhammer coat. I know
it was him 'cause I took a good look at him that
time you pointed him out at church that evenin'. I
wondered was he <i>in with</i> them swells?"</p>

<p>Her tone expressed scorn and not a little anxiety,
as if she had asked whether he frequented places
of low reputation.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you mean, <i>could</i> he be, why that's a diffrunt
thing!" said James the wise. "<i>Sure</i>, he could
be if he wanted, I guess. He's got a good family.
His uncle's some high muckymuck, and you often see
his aunts' and cousins' names in the paper giving teas
and receptions and going places. But he don't seem
to go much. I often hear folks ask him why he
wasn't some place last night, or 'phone to know if he
won't come, and he always says he can't spare the
time, or he can't afford it, or something like that."</p>

<p>"Ain't he rich, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly. He may have some
money put away, or left him by some one. If he
don't have I can't fer the life of me see how he lives.
But he certainly don't get it in fees. I often wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
where my salary comes from, but it always does,
regular as the clock."</p>

<p>"Jimmie, doesn't he have <i>any</i> business at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes he has business, but it ain't the paying
kind. Fer instance, there was a man in to-day
trying to get his house back that another man took
away from him, and my boss <i>took the case!</i> He
took it <i>right off the bat</i> without waiting to see
whether the man could pay him anything or not!
He can't! He's only a poor laboring man, and a rich
man stole his house. Just out an' out stole it, you
know. It's how he got rich. Like as not we'll lose
it, too, those rich men have so many ways of crawling
out of a thing and making it look nice to the world.
Oh, he'll get a fee, of course&mdash;twenty-five dollars,
perhaps&mdash;but what's twenty-five dollars, and like as
not never get even the whole of that, or have to wait
for it? Why, it wouldn't keep <i>me</i> in his office long!
Then there was a girl trying to get hold of the money
her own father left her, and her uncle frittered away
and pertends it cost him all that, and <i>he's</i> been supporting
<i>her!</i> Well, we took that, too, and we won't
get much out of that even if we do win. Then there
come along one of these here rich guys with a
pocket full of money and a nice slick tongue wanting
to be protected from the law in some devilment, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<i>him we turned down flat!</i> That's how it goes in our
office. I can't just figger out how it's coming out!
But he's a good guy, a white man if there ever
was one!"</p>

<p>"I should say!" responded Jane with shining
eyes. "Say, Jimmie, what's the matter of us throwin'
a little business in his way&mdash;real, payin' business,
I mean?"</p>

<p>"Fat chance!" said Jimmie dryly.</p>

<p>"You never can tell!" answered Jane dreamily.
"I'm goin' to think about it. Our fact'ry has lawyers
sometimes. I might speak to the boss."</p>

<p>"Do!" said Jimmie sarcastically! "And have
yer labor for yer pains! We'll prob'ly turn <i>them</i>
down. Fact'ries are <i>always</i> doing things they hadn't
ought to."</p>

<p>But Jane was silent and thoughtful, and they
were presently lost in the charms of Mary Pickford.</p>

<p>The evening papers came out with pictures of
Elizabeth Stanhope and her bridegroom that was to
have been. Jane cut away the bridegroom and
pasted the bride's picture in the flyleaf of her Bible,
then hid it away in the bottom of her trunk.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Betty found herself seated on the day
coach of a way train, jogging along toward a town
she had never seen and away from the scenes and
people of her childhood, she found herself trembling violently.
It was as if she had suddenly been
placed in an airplane all by herself and started
off to the moon without any knowledge of her motor
power or destination. It both frightened and exhilarated her.
She wanted to cry and she wanted to
laugh, but she did neither. Instead she sat demurely
for the first hour and a half looking out of the window like any
traveler, scarcely turning her head nor
looking at anything in the car. It seemed to her that
there might be a detective in every seat just waiting
for her to lift her eyes that he might recognize her.
But gradually as the time dragged by and the landscape
grew monotonous she began to feel a little more
at her ease. Furtively she studied her neighbors.
She had seldom traveled in a common car, and it was
new to her to study all types as she could see them
here. She smiled at a dirty baby and wished she had
something to give it. She studied the careworn man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and the woman in black who wept behind her veil and
would not smile no matter how hard the man tried
to make her. It was a revelation to her that any
man would try as hard as that to make a woman
smile. She watched the Italian family with five
children and nine bundles, and counted the colors on
a smart young woman who got in at a way station.
Every minute of the day was interesting. Every
mile of dreary November landscape that whirled
by gave her more freedom.</p>

<p>She opened the little shabby handbag that Jane
had given her and got out the bit of mirror one
inch by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'an an'">an</ins> inch and a half backed with pasteboard
on which lingered particles of the original
green taffeta lining and studied her own strange
face, trying to get used to her new self and her new
name. Jane had written it, Lizzie Hope, on the back
of the envelope containing the address of Mrs. Carson.
It seemed somehow an identification card. She
studied it curiously and wondered if Lizzie Hope
was going to be any happier than Betty Stanhope had
been. And then she fell to thinking over the strange
experiences of the last twenty-four hours and wondering
whether she had done right or not, and
whether her father would have been disappointed
in her, "ashamed of her," as her stepmother had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
said. Somehow Jane had made her feel that he
would not, and she was more light-hearted than she
had been for many a day.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon she began to wonder what
Tinsdale would be like. In the shabby handbag
was her ticket to Tinsdale and eight dollars and a
half in change. It made her feel richer than she
had ever felt in her life, although she had never
been stinted as to pocket money. But this was her
very own, for her needs, and nobody but herself to
say how she should spend either it or her time.</p>

<p>Little towns came in sight and passed, each one
with one or two churches, a schoolhouse, a lot of
tiny houses. Would Tinsdale look this way? How
safe these places seemed, yet lonely, too! Still, no
one would ever think of looking for her in a lonely
little village.</p>

<p>They passed a big brick institution, and she made
out the words, "State Asylum," and shuddered inwardly
as she thought of what Jane had told her
about the morning paper. Suppose they should hunt
her up and <i>put her in an insane asylum</i>, just to show
the world that it had not been their fault that she
had run away from her wedding! The thought was
appalling. She dropped her head on her hand with
her face toward the window and tried to pretend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
she was asleep and hide the tears that would come,
but presently a boy came in at the station with a big
basket and she bought a ham sandwich and an apple.
It tasted good. She had not expected that it would.
She decided that she must have been pretty hungry
and then fell to counting her money, aghast that the
meager supper had made such a hole in her capital.
She must be very careful. This might be all the
money she would have for a very long time, and
there was no telling what kind of an impossible place
she was going to. She might have to get away as
eagerly as she had come. Jane was all right, but
that was not saying that her mother and sisters
would be.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, and the lights were lit in the
car. All the little Italian babies had been given drinks
of water, and strange things to eat, and tumbled to
sleep across laps and on seats, anywhere they would
stick. They looked so funny and dirty and pitiful
with their faces all streaked with soot and molasses
candy that somebody had given them. The mother
looked tired and greasy and the father was fat and
dark, with unpleasant black eyes that seemed to roll
a great deal. Yet he was kind to the babies and his
wife seemed to like him. She wondered what kind
of a home they had, and what relation the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fellow with the shiny dark curls bore to them. He
seemed to take as much care of the babies as did
their father and mother.</p>

<p>The lights were flickering out in the villages now
and gave a friendly inhabited look to the houses.
Sometimes when the train paused at stations Betty
could see people moving back and forth at what
seemed to be kitchen tables and little children bringing
dishes out, all working together. It looked pleasant
and she wondered if it would be like that where
she was going. A big lump of loneliness was growing
in her throat. It was one thing to run away from
something that you hated, but it was another to jump
into a new life where one neither knew nor was
known. Betty began to shrink inexpressibly from
it all. Not that she wanted to go back! Oh, no;
far from it! But once when they passed a little
white cemetery with tall dark fir trees waving guardingly
above the white stones she looked out almost
wistfully. If she were lying in one of those beside
her father and mother how safe and rested she
would be. She wouldn't have to worry any more.
What was it like where father and mother had gone?
Was it a real place? Or was that just the end when
one died? Well, if she were sure it was all she
would not care. She would be willing to just go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
out and not be. But somehow that didn't seem to
be the commonly accepted belief. There was always
a beyond in most people's minds, and a fear of just
what Betty didn't know. She was a good deal of
a heathen, though she did not know that either.</p>

<p>Then, just as she was floundering into a lot of
theological mysteries of her own discovery the nasal
voice of the conductor called out: "Tinsdale! Tinsdale!"
and she hurried to her feet in something of a
panic, conscious of her short hair and queer clothes.</p>

<p>Down on the platform she stood a minute trying
to get used to her feet, they felt so numb and empty
from long sitting. Her head swam just a little, too,
and the lights on the station and in the houses near
by seemed to dance around her weirdly. She had a
feeling that she would rather wait until the train was
gone before she began to search for her new home,
and then when the wheels ground and began to turn
and the conductor shouted "All aboard!" and swung
himself up the step as she had seen him do a hundred
times that afternoon, a queer sinking feeling of loneliness
possessed her, and she almost wanted to catch
the rail and swing back on again as the next pair
of car steps flung by her.</p>

<p>Then a voice that sounded a little like Jane's
said pleasantly in her ear: "Is this Lizzie Hope?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and Betty turned with a thrill of actual fright to
face Nellie Carson and her little sister Emily.</p>

<p>"Bobbie'll be here in a minute to carry your
suitcase," said Nellie efficiently; "he just went over
to see if he could borrow Jake Peter's wheelbarrow
in case you had a trunk. You didn't bring your
trunk? O, but you're going to stay, aren't you?
I'm goin' up to the city to take a p'sition, and
Mother'd be awful lonesome. Sometime of course
we'll send fer them to come, but now the children's
little an' the country's better fer them. They gotta
go to school awhile. You'll stay, won't you?"</p>

<p>"How do you know you'll want me?" laughed
Betty, at her ease in this unexpected air of welcome.</p>

<p>"Why, of course we'd want you. Jane sent you.
Jane wouldn't of sent you if you hadn't been a good
scout. Jane knows. Besides, I've got two eyes,
haven't I? I guess I can tell right off."</p>

<p>Emily's shy little hand stole into Betty's and the
little girl looked up:</p>

<p>"I'm awful glad you come! I think you're
awful pretty!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Betty, warmly squeezing
the little confiding hand. It was the first time in her
life that a little child had come close to her in this
confiding way. Her life had not been among children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Bob whirled up, bareheaded, freckled,
whistling, efficient, and about twelve years old. He
grabbed the suitcase, eyed the stranger with a
pleasant grin, and stamped off into the darkness
ahead of them.</p>

<p>It was a new experience to Betty to be walking
down a village street with little houses on each side
and lights and warmth and heads bobbing through
the windows. It stirred some memory of long ago,
before she could scarcely remember. She wondered,
had her own mother ever lived in a small village?</p>

<p>"That's our church," confided Emily, as they
passed a large frame building with pointed steeple
and belfry. "They're goin' to have a entertainment
t'morra night, an' we're all goin' and Ma said you
cud go too."</p>

<p>"Isn't that lovely!" said Betty, feeling a sudden
lump like tears in her throat. It was just like living
out a fairy story. She hadn't expected to be taken
right in to family life this way.</p>

<p>"But how did you know I was coming on that
train?" she asked the older girl suddenly. "Jane
said she was going to telegraph, but I expected to
have to hunt around to find the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, we just came down to every train after the
telegram came. This is the last train to-night, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
we were awful scared for fear you wouldn't come
till morning, an' have to stay on the train all night.
Ma says it isn't nice for a girl to have to travel
alone at night. Ma always makes Jane and me
go daytimes."</p>

<p>"It was just lovely of you," said Betty, wondering
if she was talking "natural" enough to
please Jane.</p>

<p>"Did you bob you hair 'cause you had a fever?"
asked Nellie enviously.</p>

<p>"No," said Betty, "that is, I haven't been very
well, and I thought it might be good for me," she
finished, wondering how many questions like that it
was going to be hard for her to answer without telling
a lie. A lie was something that her father had
made her feel would hurt him more deeply than
anything else she could do.</p>

<p>"I just love it," said Nellie enthusiastically. "I
wanted to cut mine, an' so did Jane, but Ma wouldn't
let us. She says God gave us our hair, an' we
oughtta take care of it."</p>

<p>"That's true, too," said Betty. "I never thought
about that. But I guess mine will grow again after a
while. I think it will be less trouble this way. But
it's very dirty with traveling. I think I'll have to
wash it before I put it on a pillow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>That had troubled Betty greatly. She didn't
know how to get rid of that hair dye before Jane's
family got used to having it dark.</p>

<p>"Sure, you can wash it, if you ain't 'fraid of
takin' cold. There's lots of hot water. Ma thought
you'd maybe want to take a bath. We've got a big
tin bath-tub out in the back shed. Ma bought it off
the Joneses when they got their porcelain one put
into their house. We don't have no runnin' water
but we have an awful good well. Here's our house.
I guess Bob's got there first. See, Ma's out on the
steps waitin' fer us."</p>

<p>The house was a square wooden affair, long
wanting paint, and trimmed with little scrollwork
around the diminutive front porch. The color was
indescribable, blending well into the surroundings
either day or night. It had a cheerful, decent look,
but very tiny. There was a small yard about it
with a picket fence, and a leafless lilac bush. A
cheerful barberry bush flanked the gate on either
side. The front door was open into a tiny hall and
beyond the light streamed forth from a glass lamp
set on a pleasant dining-room table covered with a
red cloth. Betty stepped inside the gate and found
herself enveloped in two motherly arms, and then
led into the light and warmth of the family
dining-room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a kettle of stew on the stove in the
kitchen, kept hot from supper for Betty, with fresh
dumplings just mixed before the train came in, and
bread and butter with apple sauce and cookies. They
made her sit right down and eat, before she even
took her hat off, and they all sat around her and
talked while she ate. It made her feel very much
at home as if somehow she was a real relative.</p>

<p>It came over her once how different all this was
from the house which she had called home all her
life. The fine napery, the cut glass and silver, the
stately butler! And here was she eating off a stone
china plate thick enough for a table top, with a steel
knife and fork and a spoon with the silver worn
off the bowl. She could not help wondering what
her stepmother would have said to the red and white
tablecloth, and the green shades at the windows.
There was an old sofa covered with carpet in the
room, with a flannel patchwork pillow, and a cat
cuddled up cosily beside it purring away like a tea-kettle
boiling. Somehow, poor as it was, it seemed
infinitely more attractive than any room she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ever seen before, and she was charmed with the
whole family. Bobbie sat at the other end of the
table with his elbows on the table and his round eyes
on her. When she smiled at him he winked one eye
and grinned and then wriggled down under the table
out of sight.</p>

<p>The mother had tired kind eyes and a firm cheerful
mouth like Jane's. She took Betty right in as if
she had been her sister's child.</p>

<p>"Come, now, get back there, Emily. Don't hang
on Lizzie. She'll be tired to death of you right at
the start. Give her a little peace while she eats
her supper. How long have you and Jane been
friends, Lizzie?" she asked, eager for news of her
own daughter.</p>

<p>Betty's cheeks flushed and her eyes grew troubled.
She was very much afraid that being Lizzie was
going to be hard work:</p>

<p>"Why, not so very long," she said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Are you one of the girls in her factory?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Betty wildly, wondering what
would come next. "We&mdash;just met&mdash;that is&mdash;why&mdash;<i>out
one evening!</i>" she finished desperately.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" said the mother. "Yes, she wrote
about going out sometimes, mostly to the movies.
And to church. My children always make it a point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to go to church wherever they are. I brought 'em
up that way. I hope you go to church."</p>

<p>"I shall love to," said Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>"Is your mother living?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"No," answered Betty. "Mother and father
are both dead and I've been having rather a hard
time. Jane was kind to me when I was in trouble."</p>

<p>"I'll warrant you! That's Jane!" beamed her
mother happily. "Jane always was a good girl, if
I do say so. I knew Jane was at her tricks again
when she sent me that telegram."</p>

<p>"Ma's got you a place already!" burst out
Nellie eagerly.</p>

<p>"Now, Nellie, you said you'd let Ma tell that!"
reproached Bob. "You never can keep your
mouth shut."</p>

<p>"There! There! Bob, don't spoil the evening
with anything unkind," warned the mother. "Yes,
Lizzie, I got you a position. It just happened I had
the chance, and I took it, though I don't really
b'lieve that anythin' in this world just happens, of
course. But it did seem providential. Mrs. Hathaway
wanted somebody to look after her little girl.
She's only three years old and she is possessed to
run away every chance she gets. Course I s'pose
she's spoiled. Most rich children are. Now, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
children wouldn't have run away. They always
thought too much of what I said to make me trouble.
But that's neither here nor there. She does it, and
besides her Ma is an invalid. She had an operation,
so she has to lie still a good bit, and can't be
bothered. She wants somebody just to take the little
girl out walking and keep her happy in the house,
an' all."</p>

<p>"How lovely!" exclaimed Betty. "I shall enjoy
it, I know."</p>

<p>"She's awful pretty!" declared Emily eagerly.
"Got gold curls and blue eyes just like you, and she
has ever an' ever so many little dresses, and wears
pink shoes and blue shoes, an' rides a tricycle."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" said Betty.</p>

<p>"You'll get good wages," said the mother. "She
said she'd give you six dollars a week, an' mebbe
more, an' you'd get some of your meals."</p>

<p>"Then I can pay my board to you," cried Betty.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, child. We'll fix that up
somehow. We're awful glad to have you come, and
I guess we shall like each other real well. Now,
children, it's awful late. Get to bed. Scat! Lizzie
can have her bath an' get to bed, too. Come, mornin's
half way here already!"</p>

<p>The children said good night and Betty was introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the tin bath tub and improvised bathroom&mdash;a
neat little addition to the kitchen evidently intended
originally for a laundry. She wanted to
laugh when she saw the primitive makeshifts, but
instead the tears came into her eyes to think how
many luxuries she had taken all her life as a matter
of course and never realized how hard it was for
people who had none. In fact it had never really
entered her head before that there were people who
had no bathrooms.</p>

<p>Betty was not exactly accustomed to washing
her own hair, and with the added problem of the dye
it was quite a task; but she managed it at last, using
all the hot water, to get it so that the rinsing water
was clear, and her hair felt soft. Then, attired in
the same warm nightgown she had worn the night
before, which Jane had thoughtfully put in the suitcase&mdash;otherwise
filled with old garments she wished
to send home&mdash;Betty pattered upstairs to the little
room with the sloping roof and the dormer window
and crept into bed with Nellie. That young woman
had purposely stayed awake, and kept Betty as long
as she could talk, telling all the wonderful things she
wanted to know about city life, and Betty found herself
in deep water sometimes because the city life
she knew about was so very different from the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
life that Jane would know. But at last sleep won,
and Nellie had to give up because her last question
was answered with silence. The guest was deep
in slumber.</p>

<p>The next morning the children took her over the
house, out in the yard, showing her everything. Then
they had to take her down to the village and explain
all about the little town and its people. They were
crazy about Betty's beautiful hair and much disappointed
when she would insist on wearing her hat.
It was a bright sunny morning, not very cold, and
they told her that nobody wore a hat except to
church or to go on the train, but Betty had a feeling
that her hair might attract attention, and in her
first waking hours a great shadow of horror had
settled upon her when she realized that her people
would leave no stone unturned to find her. It was
most important that she should do or be nothing
whereby she might be recognized. She even thought
of getting a cap and apron to wear when attending
her small charge, but Nellie told her they didn't do
that in the country and she would be thought stuck
up, so she desisted. But she drew the blue serge
skirt up as high above her waistband as possible
when she dressed in the morning so that she might
look like a little girl and no one would suspect her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of being a runaway bride. Also she had a consultation
with herself in the small hours of the morning
while Nellie was still fast asleep, and settled with
her conscience just what she would tell about her
past and what she would keep to herself. There was
a certain reserve that any one might have, and if
she was frank about a few facts no one would be
likely to question further.</p>

<p>So next morning she told Mrs. Carson that since
her parents' death she had lived with a woman who
knew her father well, but lately things had been
growing very unpleasant and she found she had to
leave. She had left under such conditions that she
could not bring away anything that belonged to
her, so she would have to work and earn some
more clothes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson looked into her sweet eyes and
agreed that it was the best thing she could do; they
might follow her up and make all sorts of trouble
for her in her new home if she wrote for her things;
and so the matter dropped. They were simple folks,
who took things at their face value and were not
over inquisitive.</p>

<p>On the third day there arrived a long letter from
Jane in which she gave certain suggestions concerning
the new member of the family, and ended: "Ma,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
she's got a story, but don't make her tell any more
of it than she wants. She's awful sensitive about
it, and trust me, she's all right! She's been through
a lot. Just make her feel she's got some folks that
loves and trusts her."</p>

<p>Ma, wise beyond her generation and experience,
said no more, and took the little new daughter into
her heart. She took the opportunity to inform the
village gossips that a friend of Jane's had come to
rest up and get a year's country air, boarding with
them; and so the amalgamation of Betty Stanhope
into the life of the little town began.</p>

<p>The "job" proved to be for only part of the
day, so that Betty was free most of the mornings
to help around the house and take almost a daughter's
place. That she was a rare girl is proved by the
way she entered into her new life. It was almost as
if she had been born again, and entered into a new
universe, so widely was her path diverging from
everything which had been familiar in the old life.
So deep had been her distress before she came into it
that this new existence, despite its hard and unaccustomed
work, seemed almost like heaven.</p>

<p>It is true there was much bad grammar and
slang, but that did not trouble Betty. She had been
brought up to speak correctly, and it was second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
nature to her, but no one had ever drummed it into
her what a crime against culture an illiterate way
of speaking could be. She never got into the way of
speaking that way herself, but it seemed a part of
these people she had come to know and admire so
thoroughly, as much as for a rose to have thorns,
and so she did not mind it. Her other world had
been so all-wrong for years that the hardships of this
one were nothing. She watched them patch and
sacrifice cheerfully to buy their few little plain coarse
new things. She marveled at their sweetness and
content, where those of her world would have
thought they could not exist under the circumstances.</p>

<p>She learned to make that good stew with carrots
and celery and parsley and potatoes and the smallest
possible amount of meat, that had tasted so delicious
the night she arrived. She learned the charms of the
common little bean, and was proud indeed the day
she set upon the table a luscious pan of her own baking,
rich and sweet and brown with their coating
of molasses well baked through them. She even
learned to make bread and never let any one
guess that she had always supposed it something
mysterious.</p>

<p>During the week that Nellie was preparing to
go to the city, Betty had lessons in sewing. Nellie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
would bring down an old garment, so faded and
worn that it would seem only fit for the rag-bag.
She would rip and wash, dye with a mysterious little
package of stuff, press, and behold, there would come
forth pretty breadths of cloth, blue or brown or
green, or whatever color was desired. It seemed like
magic. And then a box of paper-patterns would be
brought out, and the whole evening would be spent
in contriving how to get out a dress, with the help
of trimmings or sleeves of another material. Betty
would watch and gradually try to help, but she found
there were so many strange things to be considered.
There, for instance, was the up and down of a thing
and the right and wrong of it. It was exactly like
life. And one had to plan not to have both sleeves
for one arm, and to have the nap of the goods running
down always. It was as complicated as learning
a new language. But at the end of the week there
came forth two pretty dresses and a blouse. Betty,
as she sat sewing plain seams and trying to help all
she could, kept thinking of the many beautiful frocks
she had thrown aside in the years gone by, and of the
rich store of pretty things that she had left when she
fled. If only Nellie and Jane and little Emily could
have them! Ah, and if only she herself might have
them now! How she needed them! For a girl who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
had always had all she wanted it was a great change
to get along with this one coarse serge and aprons.</p>

<p>But the sewing and other work had not occupied
them so fully that they had not had time to introduce
Betty into their little world. The very next
evening after she arrived she had been taken to
that wonderful church entertainment that the girls
had told her about on the way from the station, and
there she had met the minister's wife and been invited
to her Sabbath school class.</p>

<p>Betty would not have thought of going if Nellie
and her mother had not insisted. In fact, she shrank
unspeakably from going out into the little village
world. But it was plain that this was expected of
her, and if she remained here she must do as they
wanted her to do. It was the least return she could
make to these kind people.</p>

<p>The question of whether or not she should remain
began to come to her insistently now. The children
clamored every day for her to bind herself for the
winter, and Jane's mother had made her most welcome.
She saw that they really wanted her; why
should she not stay? And yet it did seem queer
to arrange deliberately to spend a whole year in a
poor uncultured family. Still, where could she go
and hope to remain unknown if she attempted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
get back into her own class? It was impossible. Her
mother had just the one elderly cousin whom she
had always secretly looked to to help her in any
time of need, but his failing her and sending that
telegram without even a good wish in it, just at the
last minute, too, made her feel it was of no use to
appeal to him. Besides, that was the first place her
stepmother would seek for her. She had many good
society friends, but none who would stand by her in
trouble. No one with whom she had ever been intimate
enough to confide in. She had been kept
strangely alone in her little world after all, hedged
in by servants everywhere. And now that she was
suddenly on her own responsibility, she felt a great
timidity in taking any step alone. Sometimes at
night when she thought what she had done she was
so frightened that her heart would beat wildly as if
she were running away from them all yet. It was
like a nightmare that pursued her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hathaway had sent for her and made
arrangements for her to begin her work with the
little Elise the following week when the present
governess should leave, and Betty felt that this might
prove a very pleasant way to earn her living. The
Hathaways lived in a great brick house away back
from the street in grounds that occupied what in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
city would have been a whole block. There was a
high hedge about the place so that one could not see
the road, and there were flower-beds, a great fountain,
and a rustic summerhouse. Betty did not see
why days passed in such a pleasant place would not
be delightful in summertime. She was not altogether
sure whether she would like to have to be a
sort of servant in the house&mdash;and of course these
cold fall days she would have to be much in the house&mdash;but
the nursery had a big fireplace in it, a long
chest under the window where toys were kept, and
many comfortable chairs. That ought to be pleasant,
too. Besides, she was not just out looking for pleasant
things on this trip. She was trying to get away
from unbearable ones, and she ought to be very
thankful indeed to have fallen on such comfort as
she had.</p>

<p>There was another element in the Carson home
that drew her strongly, although she was shy about
even thinking of it, and that was the frank, outspoken
Christianity. "Ma" tempered all her talk
with it, adjusted all her life to God and what He
would think about her actions, spoke constantly of
what was right and wrong. Betty had never lived
in an atmosphere where right and wrong mattered.
Something sweet and pure like an instinct in her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
soul had held her always from many of the ways of
those about her, perhaps the spirit of her sweet
mother allowed to be one of those who "bear them
up, lest at any time they dash their feet against
a stone." Or it might have been some memory of
the teachings of her father, whom she adored, and
who in his last days often talked with her alone
about how he and her own mother would want her
to live. But now, safe and quiet in this shelter of a
real home, poor though it was, the God-instinct
stirred within her, caused her to wonder what He
was, why she was alive, and if He cared? One could
not live with Mrs. Carson without thinking something
about her God, for He was an ever-present
help in all her times of need, and she never hesitated
to give God the glory for all she had achieved, and
for all the blessings she had received.</p>

<p>The very first Sabbath in the little white church
stirred still deeper her awakening interest in spiritual
things. The minister's wife was a sweet-faced
woman who called her "my dear" and invited her
to come and see her, and when she began to teach
the lesson Betty found to her amazement that it was
interesting. She spoke of God in much the same
familiar way that "Ma" had done, only with a
gentler refinement, and made the girls very sure that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
whatever anybody else believed, Mrs. Thornley was
a very intimate friend of Jesus Christ. Betty loved
her at once, but so shy was she that the minister's
wife never dreamed it, and remarked to her husband
Sunday night after church, when they were having
their little, quiet Sabbath talk together, that she was
afraid she was going to have a hard time winning
that little new girl that had come to live with
Mrs. Carson.</p>

<p>"Somehow I can't get away from the thought
that she comes from aristocracy somewhere," she
added. "It's the way she turns her head, or lifts
her eyes or the quiet assurance with which she answers.
And she smiles, Charles, never grins like the
rest. She is delicious, but somehow I find myself
wondering if I have remembered to black my shoes
and whether my hat is on straight, when she looks
at me."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe she's the daughter of some black
sheep who has gone down a peg, and our Father has
sent her here for you to help her back again," said
her husband with an adorable look at his helper. "If
anyone can do it you can."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," she said, shaking her head.
"She maybe doesn't need me. She has Mrs. Carson,
remember, and she is a host in herself. If anybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
can lead her to Christ she can, plain as she is."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly you were meant to help, too, dear,
or she would not have been sent to you."</p>

<p>His wife smiled brilliantly a look of thorough
understanding: "Oh, I know. I'm not going to shirk
any but I wish I knew more about her. She is so
sad and quiet, I can't seem to get at her."</p>

<p>Even at that moment Betty lay in her little cot
bed under the roof thinking about the minister's wife
and what she had said about Christ being always
near, ready to show what to do, if one had the listening
heart and the ready spirit. Would Christ tell
her what to do, she wondered, now right here, if
she were to ask him? Would He show her whether
to stay in this place or seek further to hide herself
from the world? Would He show her how to earn
her living and make her life right and sweet as it
ought to be.</p>

<p>Then she closed her eyes and whispered softly
under the sheltering bedclothes, "O Christ, if you
are here, please show me somehow and teach me
to understand."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Betty had been in Tinsdale about a month
it was discovered that she could play the piano. It
happened on a rainy Sunday in Sunday school, and
the regular pianist was late. The superintendent
looked about helplessly and asked if there was anybody
present who could play, although he knew the
musical ability of everybody in the village. The minister's
wife had already pleaded a cut finger which
was well wrapped up in a bandage, and he was about
to ask some one to start the tune without the piano
when Mrs. Thornton leaned over with a sudden
inspiration to Betty and asked:</p>

<p>"My dear, you couldn't play for us, could you?"</p>

<p>Betty smiled assent, and without any ado went to
the instrument, not realizing until after she had done
so that it would have been better policy for her to
have remained as much in the background as possible,
and not to have shown any accomplishments
lest people should suspect her position. However,
she was too new at acting a part to always think
of these little things, and she played the hymns so
well that they gathered about her after the hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was over and openly rejoiced that there was another
pianist in town. The leader of Christian Endeavor
asked her to play in their meeting sometimes, and
Betty found herself quite popular. The tallest girl
in their class, who had not noticed her before, smiled
at her and patronized her after she came back from
playing the first hymn, and asked her where she
learned to play so well.</p>

<p>"Oh, I used to take lessons before my father
died," she said, realizing that she must be careful.</p>

<p>Emily and Bob came home in high feather and
told their mother, who had not been able to get out
that morning, and she beamed on Betty with as warm
a smile as if she had been her own daughter:</p>

<p>"Now, ain't that great!" she said, and her
voice sounded boyish just like Jane's. "Why, we'll
have to get a pianna. I heard you could get 'em
cheap in the cities sometimes&mdash;old-fashioned ones,
you know. I heard they have so many old-fashioned
ones that they have to burn 'em to get rid of 'em,
and they even give 'em away sometimes. I wonder,
could we find out and get hold of one?"</p>

<p>"I guess 'twould cost too much to get it here,"
said Bob practically. "My! I wisht we had one.
Say, Lizzie, 'f we had a pianna would you show me
how to read notes?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," said Betty.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get one somehow! We always do
when we need anything awfully. Look at the bathtub!
Good-night! I'm goin' to earn one myself!"
declared Bob.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crosby's gotta get a new one. P'raps
she'll sell us her old one cheap."</p>

<p>That was the way the music idea started, and
nothing else was talked of at the table for days but
how to get a piano. Then one day Emily came rushing
home from school all out of breath, her eyes as
bright as stars, and her cheeks like roses. "Mrs.
Barlow came to our school to-day and talked to the
teacher, and I heard her say she was going away for
the winter. She's going to store her goods in the
Service Company barn, but she wants to get somebody
to take care of her piano. I stepped right up
and told her my mother was looking for a piano, and
we'd be real careful of it, and she's just delighted;
and&mdash;it's coming to-morrow morning at nine o'clock!
The man's going to bring it!"</p>

<p>She gasped it out so incoherently that they had
to make her tell it over twice to get any sense out of
it; but when Bob finally understood he caught his
little sister in his arms and hugged her with a
big smacking kiss:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"You sure are a little peach, Em'ly!" he shouted.
"You're a pippin of the pippins! I didn't know you
had that much nerve, you kid, you! I sure am proud
of you! My! Think of havin' a pianna! Say,
Betty, I can play the base of chopsticks now!"</p>

<p>The next evening when Betty got home from
the Hathaways there was the piano standing in
the big space opposite the windows in the dining-room.
Ma had elected to have it there rather than
in the front room, because it might often be too cold
in the front room for the children to practice, and
besides it wouldn't be good for the piano. So the
piano became a beloved member of the family, and
Betty began to give instructions in music, wondering
at herself that she knew how, for her own music had
been most desultory, and nobody had ever cared
whether she practiced or not. She had been allowed
to ramble among the great masters for the most
part unconducted, with the meagerest technique, and
her own interpretation. She could read well and
her sense of time and rhythm were natural, else she
would have made worse work of it than she did.
But she forthwith set herself to practicing, realizing
that it might yet stand her in good stead since she
had to earn her living.</p>

<p>Little Emily and Bob stood one on either side and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
watched her as she played, with wondering admiration,
and when Betty went to help their mother Bob
would sit down and try to imitate what she had done.
Failing, he would fall headlong into the inevitable
chopsticks, beating it out with the air of a master.</p>

<p>It was the piano that brought to Betty's realization
the first real meaning of the Sabbath day. Bob
came down early and went at the piano as usual
banging out chopsticks, and a one-fingered arrangement
of "The Long, Long Trail," while his mother
was getting breakfast. Betty was making the coffee,
proud of the fact that she had learned how. But
Bob had accomplished only a brief hint of his regular
program when the music stopped suddenly and Betty
glanced through the kitchen door to see Ma standing
with her hand on her son's shoulder and a look on
her face she had not seen before: It was quite gentle,
but it was decided:</p>

<p>"No, Bob! We won't have that kinda music on
Sunday," she said. "This is God's day, an' we'll
have all we can rightly do to keep it holy without
luggin' in week-day music to make us forget it.
You just get t' work an' learn 'Safely Through Another
Week,' an' if you can't play it right you get
Lizzie to teach you."</p>

<p>Bob pouted:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' wrong with chopsticks, Ma.
'Tain't got words to it."</p>

<p>"Don't make any diffrence. It b'longs to weekdays
an' fun, an' anyhow it makes you think of other
things, an' you can't keep your mind on God. That's
what Sunday was made fer, to kinda tone us up to
God, so's we won't get so far away in the week that
we won't be any kind of ready for heaven some time.
An' anyhow, 'tisn't seemly. You better go learn
your Golden Text, Bob. The minister'll be disappointed
if you don't have it fine."</p>

<p>Betty stood by the window thoughtfully looking
out. Was that what Sunday was made for, or was it
only a quaint idea of this original woman? She
wished she knew. Perhaps some time she would
know the minister's wife well enough to ask. She
would have liked to ask Ma more about it, but somehow
felt shy. But Ma herself was started now, and
when she came back to the kitchen, as if she felt
some explanation was due the new inmate of the
family, she said:</p>

<p>"I don't know how you feel about it. I know
city folks don't always hold to the old ways. But it
always seemed to me God meant us to stick to Sunday,
and make it diff'rent from other days. I never
would let my children go visitin', nor play ball an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we always tried to have something good for supper
fixed the night before. I heard somebody say a
long time ago that it says somewhere in the Bible that
Sunday was meant to be a sign forever between God
and folks. The ones that keeps it are his'n, an' them
as don't aren't. Anyhow, that's the only day we
have got to kinda find out what's wanted of us. You
wouldn't mind just playin' hymns and Sunday things
t'day, would you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Betty, interested. "I like it. It
sounds so kind of safe, and as if God cared. I never
thought much about it before. You think God really
thinks about us and knows what we're doing then,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure, child. I don't just think, I <i>know</i> He
does. Hadn't you never got onto that? Why, you
poor little ducky, you! O' course He does."</p>

<p>"I'd like to feel sure that He was looking out for
me," breathed Betty wistfully.</p>

<p>"Well, you can!" said Ma, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hrurrying'">hurrying</ins> back to
see that her bacon didn't burn. "It's easy as rollin'
off a log."</p>

<p>"What would I have to do?"</p>

<p>"Why, just b'lieve."</p>

<p>"Believe?" asked Betty utterly puzzled. "Believe
what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, believe that He'll do it. He said 'Come
unto me, an' I will give you rest,' an' He said, 'Cast
your burden on the Lord,' an' He said 'Castin' all
yer care 'pon Him, fer He careth fer you,' an' a
whole lot more such things, an' you just got to take
it fer straight, an' act on it."</p>

<p>"But how could I?" asked Betty.</p>

<p>"Just run right up to your room now, while
you're feelin' that way, an' kneel down by your bed
an' tell Him what you just told me," said Mrs. Carson,
stirring the fried potatoes with her knife to
keep them from burning. "It won't take you long,
an' I'll tend the coffee. Just you tell Him you want
Him to take care of you, an' you'll believe what I
told you He said. It's all in the Bible, an' you can
read it for yourself, but I wouldn't take the time now.
Just run along an' speak it out with Him, and, then
come down to breakfast."</p>

<p>Betty was standing by the kitchen door, her hand
on her heart, as if about to do some great wonderful
thing that frightened her:</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Carson, suppose, maybe, He might
not be pleased with me. Suppose I've done something
that He doesn't like, something that makes
Him ashamed of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, why, didn't you know He fixed for all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
when He sent His Son to be the Saviour of the
world? We all do wrong things, an' everybody
has sinned. But ef we're rightly sorry, He'll fergive
us, and make us His children."</p>

<p>Betty suddenly sat down in a chair near the door:</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Carson, I'm not sure I <i>am</i> sorry&mdash;at
least I know I'm <i>not</i>. I'm afraid I'd do it all over
again if I got in the same situation."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson stood back from the stove and surveyed
her thoughtfully a moment:</p>

<p>"Well, then, like's not it wasn't wrong at all,
and if it wasn't He ain't displeased. You can bank
on that. You better go talk it out to Him. Just
get it off your mind. I'll hold up breakfast a minute
while you roll it on Him and depend on it he'll
show you in plenty of time for the next move."</p>

<p>Betty with her cheeks very red and her eyes shining
went up to her little cot, and with locked door
knelt and tried to talk to God for the first time in
her life. It seemed queer to her, but when she arose
and hurried back to her duties she had a sense of
having a real Friend who knew all about her and
could look after things a great deal better than
she could.</p>

<p>That night she went with Bob and Emily to the
young people's meeting and heard them talk about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Christ familiarly as if they knew Him. It was all
strange and new and wonderful to Betty, and she sat
listening and wondering. The old question of
whether she was pleasing her earthly father was
merging itself into the desire to please her Heavenly
Father.</p>

<p>There were of course many hard and unpleasant
things about her new life. There were so many
things to learn, and she was so awkward at work
of all kinds! Her hands seemed so small and inadequate
when she tried to wring clothes or scrub a dirty
step. Then, too, her young charge, Elise Hathaway,
was spoiled and hard to please, and she was daily
tried by the necessity of inventing ways of discipline
for the poor little neglected girl which yet would
not bring down a protest from her even more undisciplined
mother. If she had been independent she
would not have remained with Mrs. Hathaway, for
sometimes the child was unbearable in her naughty
tantrums, and it took all her nerve and strength
to control her. She would come back to the little
gray house too weary even to smile, and the keen eye
of Ma would look at her wisely and wonder if something
ought not to be done about it.</p>

<p>Betty felt that she must keep this place, of course,
because it was necessary for her to be able to pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
some board. She could not be beholden to the Carsons.
And they had been so kind, and were teaching
her so many things, that it seemed the best and safest
place she could be in. So the days settled down
into weeks, and a pleasant life grew up about her,
so different from the old one that more and more
the hallucination was with her that she had
become another creature, and the old life had gone
out forever.</p>

<p>Of course as striking-looking a girl as Betty could
not enter into the life of a little town even as humbly
as through the Carson home, without causing some
comment and speculation. People began to notice
her. The church ladies looked after her and remarked
on her hair, her complexion, and her graceful
carriage, and some shook their heads and said
they should think Mrs. Hathaway would want to
know a little more about her before she put her only
child in her entire charge; and they told weird
stories about girls they had known or heard of.</p>

<p>Down at the fire-house, which was the real clearing-house
of Tinsdale for all the gossip that came
along and went the rounds, they took up the matter
in full session several evenings in succession. Some
of the younger members made crude remarks about
Betty's looks, and some of the older ones allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that she was entirely too pretty to be without a history.
They took great liberties with their surmises.
The only two, the youngest of them all, who might
have defended her, had been unconsciously snubbed
by her when they tried to be what Bobbie called
"fresh" with her, and so she was at their mercy.
But if she had known it she probably would have been
little disturbed. They seemed so far removed from
her two worlds, so utterly apart from herself. It
would not have occurred to her that they could do her
any harm.</p>

<p>One night the fire-house gang had all assembled
save one, a little shrimp of a good-for-nothing,
nearly hairless, toothless, cunning-eyed, and given to
drink when he could lay lips on any. He had a wide
loose mouth with a tendency to droop crookedly,
and his hands were always clammy and limp. He
ordinarily sat tilted back against the wall to the right
of the engine, sucking an old clay pipe. He had a
way of often turning the conversation to imply some
deep mystery known only to himself behind the life
of almost any one discussed. He often added choice
embellishments to whatever tale went forth as authentic
to go the rounds of the village, and he acted
the part of a collector of themes and details for the
evening conversations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>His name was Abijah Gage.</p>

<p>"Bi not come yet?" asked the fire chief settling
a straw comfortably between his teeth and looking
around on the group. "Must be somepin' doin'.
Don't know when Bi's been away."</p>

<p>"He went up to town this mornin' early," volunteered
Dunc Withers. "Reckon he was thirsty.
Guess he'll be back on the evenin' train. That's her
comin' in now."</p>

<p>"Bars all closed in the city," chuckled the chief.
"Won't get much comfort there."</p>

<p>"You bet Bi knows some place to get it. He
won't come home thirsty, that's sure."</p>

<p>"I donno, they say the lid's down pretty tight."</p>

<p>"Aw, shucks!" sneered Dunc. "Bet I could
get all I wanted."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Abijah Gage
walked in, with a toothless grin all around.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bi, get tanked up, did yeh?" greeted
the chief.</p>

<p>"Well, naow, an' ef I did, what's that to you?"
responded Bi, slapping the chief's broad shoulder
with a folded newspaper he carried. "You don't
'spose I'm goin' to tell, an' get my frien's in trouble?"</p>

<p>"Le's see yer paper, Bi," said Dunc, snatching
at it as Bi passed to his regular seat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Bi surrendered his paper with the air of one granting
a high favor and sank to his chair and his pipe.</p>

<p>"How's crops in the city?" asked Hank Fielder,
and Bi's tale was set a-going. Bi could talk; that was
one thing that always made him welcome.</p>

<p>Dunc was deep in the paper. Presently he turned
it over:</p>

<p>"Whew!" he said speculatively. "If that don't
look like that little lollypop over to Carson's I'll eat
my hat! What's her name?"</p>

<p>They all drew around the paper and leaned over
Dunc's shoulder squinting at the picture, all but Bi,
who was lighting his pipe:</p>

<p>"They're as like as two peas!" said one.</p>

<p>"It sure must be her sister!" declared another.</p>

<p>"Don't see no resemblance 'tall," declared the
chief, flinging back to his comfortable chair. "She's
got short hair, an she's only a kid. This one's
growed up!"</p>

<p>"She might a cut her hair," suggested one.</p>

<p>Bi pricked up his ears, narrowed his cunning
eyes, and slouched over to the paper, looking at the
picture keenly:</p>

<p>"Read it out, Dunc!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars reward for information
concerning Elizabeth Stanhope!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There followed a description in detail of her size,
height, coloring, etc.</p>

<p>An inscrutable look overspread Bi's face and hid
the cunning in his eyes. He slouched to his seat during
the reading and tilted back comfortably smoking,
but he narrowed his eyes to a slit and spoke
little during the remainder of the evening. They
discussed the picture and the possibility of the girl in
the paper being a relative of the girl at Carson's,
but as Bi did not come forward with information the
subject languished. Some one said he had heard
the Carson kid call her Lizzie, he thought, but he
wasn't sure. Ordinarily Bi would have known the
full name, but Bi seemed to be dozing, and so the
matter was finally dropped. But the hounds were
out and on the scent, and it was well for Betty
sleeping quietly in her little cot beneath the roof of
the humble Carson home, that she had committed her
all to her heavenly Father before she slept.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, he gave me notice t'day," said James
Ryan sadly as Jane and he rounded the corner from
her boarding-house and turned toward their favorite
movie theater. "I been expectin' it, an' now
it's come!"</p>

<p>Jane stopped short on the sidewalk appalled:</p>

<p>"He gave you notice!" she exclaimed, as if
she could not believe it was true. "Now, Jimmie!
You don't mean it? Did he find any fault? He'd
better not! B'leeve me, if he did he gets a piece of
<i>my</i> mind, even if I am a poor workin' girl!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he didn't find any fault," said Jimmie
cheerfully. "He was awful nice! He said he'd
recommend me away up high. He's gonta give me
time every day to hunt a new place, an' he's gonta
recommend me to some of his rich friends."</p>

<p>"But what's the matter of him keepin' you?
Did you ast him that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he told me right out that things wasn't
working the way he hoped when he started; the war
and all had upset his prospects, and he couldn't afford
to keep me. He's gonta take an office way down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
town and do his own letters. He says if he ever
succeeds in business and I'm free to come to him
he'll take me back. Oh, he's pleased with me all
right! He's a peach! He certainly is."</p>

<p>"Jimmie, what d'you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Tell him? There wasn't much for me to tell
him, only I was sorry, and I thanked him, and I told
him I was gonta stick by him as long as I didn't have
a place. Of course I can't live on air, but seeing he's
willing I should go out and hunt a place every day,
why I ain't that mean that I can't write a few letters
for him now and then. He don't have that many,
and it keeps me in practice. I s'pose I've got to get
another place but I haven't tried yet. I can't somehow
bring myself to give him up. I kind of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wante '">wanted</ins>
to stick in my first place a long time. It doesn't <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'l   '">look</ins>
well to be changing."</p>

<p>"Well, if it ain't your fault, you know, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wh      '">when you</ins>
can't help it," advised Jane.</p>

<p>They were seated in the theater by this time, and
the screen claimed their attention. It was just at the
end of the funny reel, and both forgot more serious
matters in following the adventures of a dog and a
bear who were chasing each other through endless
halls and rooms, to say nothing of bathtubs, and
wash boilers, and dining tables, and anything that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
came in their way, with a shock to the people who
happened to be around when they passed. But
suddenly the film ended and the announcements for
the next week began to flash on the screen.</p>

<p>"We must go to that, sure!" said Jimmie,
nudging Jane, as the Mary Pickford announcement
was put on.</p>

<p>Then immediately afterward came the photograph
of a beautiful girl, and underneath in
great letters:</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Five Thousand Dollars' Reward for Accurate<br />
Information as to the Present Whereabouts<br />
of Elizabeth Stanhope</span><br />
</div>

<p>There followed further particulars and an address
and the showing stayed on the screen for a
full minute.</p>

<p>Jane sat gripping the arms of the seat and trying
to still the wild excitement that possessed her, while
her eyes looked straight into the eyes of the little
bride whom she had helped to escape on the night
of her wedding.</p>

<p>Jimmie took out his pencil and wrote down the
address in shorthand, but Jane did not notice. She
was busy thinking what she ought to do.</p>

<p>"What do you s'pose they want her for?" she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
asked in a breathless whisper, as a new feature film
began to dawn on the screen.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's mebbe eloped," said the wise young
man, "or there might be some trouble about property.
There mostly is."</p>

<p>Jane said no more, and the pictures began again,
but her mind was not following them. She was very
quiet on the way home, and when Jimmie asked her
if she had a grouch on she shivered and said, no, she
guessed she was tired. Then she suddenly asked him
what time he was going out to hunt for another job.
He told her he couldn't be sure. He would call her
up about noon and let her know. Could she manage
to get out a while and meet him? She wasn't sure
either, but would see when he called her up. And
so they parted for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning when Reyburn entered his
office Jimmie was already seated at his typewriter.
On Reyburn's desk lay a neatly typed copy of the
announcement that had been put on the screen the
night before.</p>

<p>"What's this, Ryan?" he questioned as he took
his seat and drew the paper toward him.</p>

<p>"Something I saw last night on the screen at
the movies, sir. I thought it might be of interest."</p>

<p>"Were you thinking of trying for the reward?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
asked Reyburn with a comical smile. "What is it,
anyway?" And he began to read.</p>

<p>"Oh, no sir!" said Jimmie. "<i>I</i> couldn't, of
course; but I thought mebbe <i>you'd</i> be able to find out
something about her and get all that money. That
would help you through until you got started in your
own business."</p>

<p>"H'm! That's kind of you, Ryan," said the
young lawyer, reading the paper with a troubled
frown. "I'm afraid it's hardly in my line, however.
I'm not a detective, you know." He laid the paper
down and looked thoughtfully out of the window.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not, sir!" Jimmie hastened to
apologize. "Only you know a lot of society folks
in the city, and I thought you might think of some
way of finding out where she is. I know it isn't up
to what you ought to be doing, sir, but it wouldn't
do any harm. You could work it through me, you
know, and nobody need ever know 'twas you got
the reward. I'd be glad to help you out doing all I
could, but of course it would take your brains to get
the information, sir. You see, it would be to my
interest, because then you could afford to keep me,
and&mdash;I like you, Mr. Reyburn, I certainly do. I
would hate to leave you."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I appreciate that, Ryan. It's very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
thoughtful of you. I scarcely think there would be
any possibility of my finding out anything about this
girl, but I certainly appreciate your thoughtfulness.
I'll make a note of it, and if anything turns up I'll
let you know. I don't believe, however, that I would
care to go after a reward even through someone else.
You know, I was at that wedding, Ryan!" His eyes
were dreamily watching the smoke from a distant
funnel over the roof-tops in line with his desk.</p>

<p>"You were!" said Jimmie, watching his employer
with rapt admiration. He had no higher ambition
than to look like Warren Reyburn and have
an office of his own.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there," said Reyburn again, but his
tone was so far off that Jimmie dared approach no
nearer, and resumed the letter he was typing.</p>

<p>About noon Jimmie called up the factory while
Reyburn was out to lunch and told Jane that he expected
to go out at two o'clock. Could she meet him
and walk a little way with him? Jane said no, she
couldn't, but she would try and see him the next
day, then he could tell her how he had "made out."</p>

<p>At exactly five minutes after two, Jane, having
watched from a telephone booth in a drug store
until Jimmie went by, hurried up to Reyburn's office
and tapped on the door, her heart in her mouth lest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he should be occupied with some one else and not be
able to see her before her few minutes of leave
which she had obtained from the factory should
have expired.</p>

<p>Reyburn himself opened the door to her, and
treated her as if she had been a lady every inch, handing
her a chair and speaking quite as if she were
attired in sealskin and diamonds.</p>

<p>She looked him over with bright eyes of approval.
Jane was a born sentimentalist, fed on the movies.
Not for anything would she have had a knight rescue
her lady fair who did not look the part. She
was entirely satisfied with this one. In fact, she was
almost tongue-tied with admiration for the moment.</p>

<p>Then she rallied to the speech she had prepared:</p>

<p>"Mr. Reyburn," she said, "I came to see you
about a matter of very great importance. I heard
you was a great lawyer, and I've got a friend that's
in trouble. I thought mebbe you could do something
about it. But first, I want to ast you a question, an'
I want you to consider it perfectly confidential!"</p>

<p>Jane took great credit to herself that she had
assembled all these words and memorized them
so perfectly.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Reyburn gravely, wondering
what kind of a customer he had now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want you to think I can't pay for it,"
said Jane, laying down a five-dollar bill grandly.
"I know you can't afford to waste your valuable
time even to answer a question."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Reyburn heartily.
"Let me hear what the question is first. There may
be no charge."</p>

<p>"No," said Jane hastily, laying the bill firmly
on the desk before him. "I shan't feel right astin'
unless I know it's to be paid for."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Reyburn, taking the bill
and laying it to one side. "Now, what is
the question?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Reyburn, will you please tell me
what would anybody want to offer a reward, a big
reward, like a thousand dollars&mdash;or several of them,&mdash;for
information about any one? Could you think
of any reason?"</p>

<p>Reyburn started. Reward again! This was uncanny.
Probably this girl had been to the movies
and seen the same picture that Ryan had told him
about. But he smiled gravely and answered, watching
her quizzically the while:</p>

<p>"Well, they might love the person that had
disappeared," he suggested at random.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Jane decidedly. "They didn't!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
I know that fer a fac'! What else could it be?"</p>

<p>"Well, they might have a responsibility!" he
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No chance!" said Jane scornfully.</p>

<p>"Couldn't they be anxious, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Not so's you'd notice it."</p>

<p>"Well, there might be some property to be
divided, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I'd thought of that," said Jane, her face growing
practical. "It would have to be a good deal of
property to make them offer a big reward,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," answered Reyburn politely,
watching her plain eager face amusedly. He could
not quite get at her idea in coming to him.</p>

<p>"Would her coming of age have anything to do
with it?" put Jane, referring to a much folded paper
she carried in her hand, as if she had a written catechism
which she must go through.</p>

<p>"It might." Reyburn was growing interested.
This queer visitor evidently had thought something
out, and was being very cautious.</p>

<p>"I really can't answer very definitely without
knowing more of the circumstances," he said with
sudden alarm lest the girl might take some random
answer and let serious matters hinge on his word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there's just one more," she said, looking
down at her paper. "If a man was trying to make a
girl marry him when she just hated him, could anybody
make her do it, and would anybody have a right
to put her in an insane 'sylum or anythin' ef
she wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course not! Where did you ever
get such a ridiculous idea?" He sat up suddenly,
annoyed beyond expression over disturbing suggestions
that seemed to rise like a bevy of black bats all
around the borders of his mind.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, sitting up very straight. "I
really can't answer any more blind questions. I've
got to know what I'm talking about. Why, I may
be saying the most impossible things without knowing
it."</p>

<p>"I know," said Jane, looking at him gravely.
"I've thought of that, but you've said just the things
I thought you would. Well, say, if I tell you about
it can you promise on yer honor you won't ever
breathe a word of it? Not to nobody? Whether
you take the case or not?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, you can trust me to look out
for any confidence you may put in me. If you
can't I should prefer that you say nothing more."</p>

<p>"Oh, I c'n trust you all right," said Jane smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"I just mean, would you be 'lowed to keep it under
yer hat?"</p>

<p>"Would I be allowed? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean would the law let you? You wouldn't
<i>have</i> to go an' tell where she was or nothin' an' give
her away? You'd be 'lowed to keep it on the q. t. an'
take care of her?"</p>

<p>"You mean would it be right and honorable for
me to protect my client? Why, certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean you wouldn't get into no trouble
if you did."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Well, then I'll tell you."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span> opened a small shabby handbag, and took
out a folded newspaper, opening it up and spreading
it on the desk before him. "There!" she said, and
then watched his face critically.</p>

<p>Reyburn looked, and found himself looking into
Betty's eyes. Only a newspaper cut, and poor at
that, but wonderfully real and mournful, as they
had struck him when she lifted them for that swift
glance before she sank in the church aisle.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" he asked, his voice
suddenly husky.</p>

<p>"Out o' the mornin' paper." Her tone was low
and excited. "Were you wanting to try for the
reward?" Reyburn asked.</p>

<p>There was a covert sneer in the question from
which the girl shrank perceptibly. She sprang to
her feet, her eyes flashing:</p>

<p>"If that's what you take me for, I better be
goin'!" she snapped and reached out her hand for
the paper. But Reyburn's hand covered the paper,
and his tone was respectful and apologetic as he said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I didn't quite understand, I see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Sit down, please. You and I must understand each
other or there is no use in our talking. You can
trust me to keep this conversation entirely to myself,
whatever the outcome. Will you tell me what it is
you want of me?"</p>

<p>Jane subsided into a chair, tears of excitement
springing into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it's pretty serious business," she
said, making a dab at the corner of one eye. "I
thought I could trust you, or I wouldn't a come.
But you gotta take me on trust, too."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Reyburn. "Now, what have
you to do with this girl? Do you know where
she is?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do!" said Jane, "but I ain't a-goin'
ta tell until you say if there's anything you can
do fer her. 'Cause you see, if you can't find a way
to help her, I've gotta do it myself, an' it might get
you into trouble somehow fer you to know what you
ain't supposed to know."</p>

<p>"I see," said Reyburn, meekly. "Well, what are
you going to tell me? Am I allowed to ask that?"</p>

<p>Jane grinned.</p>

<p>"Say, you're kiddin' me! I guess you are all
right. Well, I'll just tell you all about it. One
night last November,&mdash;you can see the date there in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the paper, I was goin' home to my boardin' house
in Camac Street, an' I was passin' the side of that
church on 18th an' Spruce, where the weddin' was&mdash;you
know, fer you was there!"</p>

<p>Reyburn looked at her astonished.</p>

<p>"How did you know I was there?"</p>

<p>"I saw you through the window, over against
the wall to the street side of the altar," said
Jane calmly.</p>

<p>"How did you know me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, somebody I know pointed you out once an'
said you was goin' to be one of the risin' lawyers of
the day," she answered nonchalantly, her face
quite serious.</p>

<p>A flicker of amusement passed like a ray of light
through his eyes, but his face was entirely grave as
he ignored the compliment.</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"I saw there was a weddin' an' I stopped to
watch a minute, 'cause I expect to get married myself
some day, an' I wanted to see how they did things.
But I couldn't get near the door, an' the windows
were all high up. I could only see folks who were
standing up like you were. So I thought I'd go on.
I turned the corner and went long-side the church
listenin' to the music, an' just as I passed a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
iron gate at the back end of the church somebody
grabbed me an' begged me to help 'em. I looked
round, an' there was the bride, all in her white togs,
with the prettiest white satin slippers, in the wet an'
mud! I tried to get her line, but she cried out
somebody was comin' back in the passageway, so I
slipped off my coat an' hat and whisked her into 'em
an' clapped my rubbers over her satin shoes, and we
beat it round the corner. I took her to my room, an'
gave her some supper. She was all in. Then I put
her to bed, an' she told me a little bit about it. She
didn't tell me much. Only that they had been tryin'
fer a long time back to make her marry a man she
hated, an' now they'd almost tricked her into it, an'
she'd die if she had to do it. She wanted to exchange
clothes with me, cause, of course, she couldn't
get anywhere togged out that way, so we changed
things, an' I fixed her up. In the mornin' I ran out
an' got a paper, an' found they was sayin' she was
temporary insane, an' stuff like that, an' so I saw
their game was tryin' to get her in a 'sylum till
they could make her do what they wanted. I fixed
her up an' got her off to a place I know where she'd
be safe. An' she's got a job an' doin' real well.
But now they've got this here reward business out
everywhere in the papers an' the movies, she ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
safe nowhere. An' I want somebody that's wiser'n
me to take a holt an' do somethin'. I can't pay much,
but I'll pay a little every month as long's I live ef
it takes that long to pay yer bill, an' I have a notion
she may have some money herself, though she didn't
say nothin' about it. But there's a ring she left
with me to sell, to pay fer what I gave her. It
oughtta be worth somethin'. It looks real. I ain't
sold it. I couldn't. I thought she might want
it sometime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Reyburn interrupted her excitedly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Miss Stanhope is in
the city and you know where she is?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't get excited," warned Jane coolly.
"I didn't say she was in this city, did I? I didn't
say where she was, did I? I said she was safe."</p>

<p>"But are you aware that you have told me a very
strange story? What proof can you give me that it
is true?"</p>

<p>Jane looked at him indignantly.</p>

<p>"Say, I thought you was goin' to trust me? I
have to trust you, don't I? Course you don't know
who I am, an' I haven't told you, but I've got a good
p'sition myself, an' I don't go round tellin' privarications!
An' there's the weddin' dress, an' veil and
fixin's! I got them. You can see 'em if you like,&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
is pervided I know what you're up to! I ain't
taking any chances till I see what you mean to do."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Reyburn, trying to
smile assurance once more. "You certainly must
own this whole thing is enough to make anybody
doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Jane. "I was some upset
myself, havin' a thing like that happen to me, a real
millionairess bride drop herself down on my hands
just like that, an' I 'spose it <i>is</i> hard to b'lieve. But
I can't waste much more time now. I gotta get back
to my job. Is there anything can be done to keep
'em from gettin' her again?"</p>

<p>"I should most certainly think so," said Reyburn,
"but I would have to know her side of the
story, the whole of it, before I could say just what!"</p>

<p>"Well, s'pose you found there wasn't anythin'
you could do to help her, would you go an' tell
on her?"</p>

<p>Reyburn leaned back in his chair and smiled at his
unique client:</p>

<p>"I shall have to quote your own language. 'What
do you take me for?'"</p>

<p>"A white man!" said Jane suddenly, and showed
all her fine teeth in an engaging smile. "Say, you're
all right. Now, I gotta go. When will you tell me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
what you can do?" She glanced anxiously at her
little leather-bound wrist watch. It was almost
time for Jimmie to return. Jimmie mustn't find her
here. He wouldn't understand, and what Jimmie
didn't know wouldn't hurt him.</p>

<p>"Well, this ought to be attended to, at once,
if anything is to be done," he said eagerly. "Let
me see. I have an engagement at five. How would
seven o'clock do? Could I call at your boarding-house?
Would there be any place where we could
talk uninterrupted?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jane, rising. "I'll get my landlady
to let me have her settin' room fer an hour."</p>

<p>"Meantime, I'll think it over and try to plan
something."</p>

<p>Jane started down the long flights of stairs, not
daring to trust to the elevator, lest she should come
face to face with Jimmie and have to explain.</p>

<p>Reyburn stood with his back to the room, his
hands in his pockets, frowning and looking out the
window, when Jimmie entered a moment later.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not late, sir?" he said anxiously,
as he hung up his hat and sat down at his typewriter.
"I had to wait. The man was out."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, Ryan," said his employer,
obviously not listening to his explanation. "I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
going out now, Ryan. I may not be back this afternoon.
Just see that everything is all right."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>Reyburn went out, then opened the door and put
his head back in the room.</p>

<p>"I may have to go out of town to-night, Ryan.
I'm not sure. Something has come up. If I'm not in
to-morrow, could you&mdash;would you mind just staying
here all day and looking after things? I may need
you. Of course you'll lock up and leave the card
out when you go to lunch."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll keep in touch with you in case I'm delayed,"
and Reyburn was off again. When the elevator had
clanked down to the next floor Jimmie went to the
window and looked dreamily out over the roofs of
the city:</p>

<p>"Aw!" he breathed joyously. "Now I'll bet
he's going to do something about that reward!"</p>

<p>Reyburn hurried down the street to the office
of an old friend where he had a bit of business
as an excuse, and asked a few casual questions when
he was done. Then he went on to a telephone booth
and called up a friend of his mother's, with whom
he had a brief gossip, ostensibly to give a message
from his mother, contained in her last letter to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
None of the questions that he asked were noticeable.
He merely led the conversation into certain grooves.
The lady was an old resident and well known in the
higher social circles. She knew all there was to
know about everybody and she loved to tell it. She
never dreamed that he had any motive in leading
her on.</p>

<p>He dropped into a bank and asked a few questions,
called up an address they gave him and made
another inquiry, then dropped around to his cousin's
home for a few minutes, where he allowed her to tell
all she knew about the Stanhope wedding they had
attended together, and the different theories concerning
the escaped bride. Quite casually he asked
if she knew whether the bride had property of her
own, if so who were her guardians. His cousin
thought she knew a lot, but, sifting it down, he discovered
that it was nearly all hearsay or surmise.</p>

<p>When he reached Jane Carson's boarding house
he found that young woman ensconced in a tiny
room, nine by twelve, a faded ingrain carpet on
the floor, a depressed looking bed lounge against the
bleary wall-paper, beneath crayon portraits of the
landlady's dead husband and sons. There was a
rocking-chair, a trunk, a cane-seat chair, and an oil
stove turned up to smoking point in honor of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
caller, but there was little room left for the caller.
On the top of the trunk reposed a large pasteboard
box securely tied.</p>

<p>Jane, after a shy greeting, untied the strings and
opened the cover, having first carefully slipped the
bolt of the door.</p>

<p>"You can't be too careful," she said. "You
never can tell."</p>

<p>Reyburn stood beside her and looked in a kind
of awe at the glistening white, recognized the thick
texture of the satin, the rare quality of the rose-point
lace with which it was adorned, caught the
faint fragrance of faded orange blossoms wafting
from the filmy mist of the veil as Jane lifted it
tenderly; then leaned over and touched a finger to
the pile of whiteness, reverently, as though he were
paying a tribute at a lovely shrine.</p>

<p>Jane even unwrapped the little slippers, one at a
time, and folded them away again, and they said no
word until it was all tied back in its papers, Reyburn
assisting with the strings.</p>

<p>"Now, ef you don't mind waitin' a minute I
guess it would be safer to put it away now," she said
as she slipped the bolt and ran upstairs.</p>

<p>She was back in a minute and sat down opposite
to him, drawing out from the neck of her blouse a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ribbon with a heavy glittering circlet at its end.</p>

<p>"Here's the ring." She laid it in his palm. He
took it, wondering, a kind of awe still upon him that
he should be thus handling the intimate belongings
of that little unknown bride whom he had seen lying
unconscious in a strange church a few short months
before. How strange that all this should have come
to him when many wiser, more nearly related, were
trying their best to get some clue to the mystery!</p>

<p>He lifted the ring toward the insufficient gas jet
to make out the initials inside, and copied them down
in his note-book.</p>

<p>"Take good care of that. It is valuable," he
said as he handed it back to her.</p>

<p>"Mebbe I better give it to you," she half
hesitated.</p>

<p>"You've taken pretty good care of it so far,"
he said. "I guess you've a better right to it than
I. Only don't let anybody know you've got it. Now,
I've been making inquiries, and I've found out a
few things, but I've about come to the conclusion
that I can't do much without seeing the lady. Do
you suppose she would see me? Is she very
far away?"</p>

<p>"When do you want to go?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>"At once," he answered decidedly. "There's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
no time to waste if she is really in danger, as
you think."</p>

<p>Jane's eyes glittered with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"There's a train at ten-thirty. You'll get there
in the morning. I've written it all down here on a
paper so you can't make any mistakes. I've written
her a letter so she'll understand and tell you everythin'.
I'll wire Ma, too, so she'll let you see her.
Ma might not size you up right."</p>

<p>Reyburn wondered at the way he accepted his
orders from this coolly impudent girl, but he liked
her in spite of himself.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more he was out in the street
again, hurrying to his own apartment, where he put
together a few necessities in a bag and went to
the train.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of those little ironies of fate that are
spoken about so much, that when Warren Reyburn
alighted from the train in Tinsdale Abijah Gage
should be supporting one corner of the station, and
contributing a quid now and then to the accumulations
of the week scattered all about his feet.</p>

<p>He spotted the stranger at once and turned his
cunning little eyes upon him, making it obvious that
he was bulging with information. It was, therefore,
quite natural, when Reyburn paused to take his bearings,
that Bi should speak up and inquire if he was
looking for some one. Reyburn shook his head and
passed on, but Bi was not to be headed off so easily
as that. He shuffled after him:</p>

<p>"Say!" he said, pointing to a shackley horse and
buckboard that stood near, belonging to a pal over
at the freight house. "Ef you want a lift I'll take
you along."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," said Reyburn, smiling; "I'm
not going far."</p>

<p>"Say!" said Bi again as he saw his quarry about
to disappear. "You name ain't Bains, is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" said Reyburn, quite annoyed by the persistent
old fellow.</p>

<p>"From New York?" he hazarded cheerfully.</p>

<p>"No," answered Reyburn, turning to go. "You
must excuse me. I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Bi contentedly. "I'll
walk a piece with you. I was lookin' fer a doctor
to take down to see a sick child. A doctor from New
York. You ain't by any chance a doctor, are you?"
Bi eyed the big leather bag inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No," said Reyburn, laughing in spite of his
annoyance. "I'm only a lawyer." And with a
bound he cleared the curb and hurried off down
the street, having now recognized the direction described
in Jane's diagram of Tinsdale.</p>

<p>Abijah Gage looked after him with twinkling
eyes of dry mirth, and slowly sauntered after him,
watching him until he entered the little unpainted
gate of the Carson house and tapped at the old gray
door. Then Bi lunged across the street and entered
a path that ran along the railroad track for a few
rods, curving suddenly into a stretch of vacant lots.
On a convenient fence rail with a good outlook
toward the west end of the village he ensconced himself
and set about whittling a whistle from some
willow stalks. He waited until he saw Bobbie Carson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hurry off toward Hathaway's house and return
with Lizzie Hope; waited hopefully until the stranger
finally came out of the house again, touching his hat
gracefully to the girl as she stood at the open door.
Then he hurried back to the station again, and
was comfortably settled on a tub of butter just
arrived by freight, when Reyburn reached there.
He was much occupied with his whistle, and never
seemed to notice, but not a movement of the stranger
escaped him, and when the Philadelphia express came
by, and the stranger got aboard the parlor car, old
Bi Gage swung his lumbering length up on the back
platform of the last car. The hounds were hot on
the trail now.</p>

<p>It was several years since Bi Gage had been on so
long a journey, but he managed to enjoy the trip,
and kept in pretty good touch with the parlor car,
although he was never in evidence. If anybody had
told Warren Reyburn as he let himself into his apartment
late that night that he was being followed, he
would have laughed and told them it was an impossibility.
When he came out to the street the next
morning and swung himself into a car that would
land him at his office, he did not see the lank flabby
figure of the toothless Bi standing just across the
block, and keeping tab on him from the back platform,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
nor notice that he slid into the office building
behind him and took the same elevator up, crowding
in behind two fat men and effacing himself against
the wall of the cage. Reyburn was reading his paper,
and did not look up. The figure slid out of the elevator
after him and slithered into a shadow, watching
him, slipping softly after, until sure which door he
took, then waited silently until sure that the door
was shut. No one heard the slouching footsteps
come down the marble hall. Bi Gage always wore
rubbers when he went anywhere in particular. He
had them on that morning. He took careful note
of the name on the door: "<i>Warren Reyburn</i>, Attorney-at-Law,"
and the number. Then he slid down
the stairs as unobserved as he had come, and made
his way to a name and number on a bit of paper
from his pocket which he consulted in the shelter
of a doorway.</p>

<p>When Warren Reyburn started on his first trip
to Tinsdale his mind was filled with varying emotions.
He had never been able to quite get away from
the impression made upon him by that little white
bride lying so still amid her bridal finery, and the
glowering bridegroom above her. It epitomized for
him all the unhappy marriages of the world, and he
felt like starting out somehow in hot pursuit of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bridegroom and making him answer for the sadness
of his bride. Whenever the matter had been brought
to his memory he had always been conscious of the
first gladness he had felt when he knew she had
escaped. It could not seem to him anything but a
happy escape, little as he knew about any of the
people who played the principal parts in the little
tragedy he had witnessed.</p>

<p>Hour after hour as he sat in the train and tried
to sleep or tried to think he kept wondering at himself
that he was going on this "wild goose chase,"
as he called it in his innermost thoughts. Yet he
knew he had to go. In fact, he had known it
from the moment James Ryan had shown him the
advertisement. Not that he had ever had any idea
of trying for that horrible reward. Simply that
his soul had been stirred to its most knightly depths
to try somehow to protect her in her hiding. Of
course, it had been a mere crazy thought then, with
no way of fulfilment, but when the chance had
offered of really finding her and asking if there was
anything she would like done, he knew from the
instant it was suggested that he was going to do it,
even if he lost every other business chance he ever
had or expected to have, even if it took all his time
and every cent he could borrow. He knew he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to try to find that girl! The thought that the only
shelter between her and the great awful world lay
in the word of an untaught girl like Jane Carson
filled him with terror for her. If that was true, the
sooner some one of responsibility and sense got to
her the better. The questions he had asked of
various people that afternoon had revealed more
than he had already guessed of the character of the
bridegroom to whom he had taken such a strong
dislike on first sight.</p>

<p>Thus he argued the long night through between
the fitful naps he caught when he was not wondering
if he should find her, and whether he would
know her from that one brief sight of her in church.
How did he know but this was some game put up
on him to get him into a mix-up? He must go cautiously,
and on no account do anything rash or
make any promises until he had first found out all
about her.</p>

<p>When morning dawned he was in a state of perturbation
quite unusual for the son and grandson
of renowned lawyers noted for their calmness and
poise under all circumstances. This perhaps was
why the little incident with Abijah Gage at the station
annoyed him so extremely. He felt he was doing
a questionable thing in taking this journey at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He certainly did not intend to reveal his identity or
business to this curious old man.</p>

<p>The little gray house looked exactly as Jane
had described it, and as he opened the gate and heard
the rusty chain that held it clank he had a sense
of having been there before.</p>

<p>He was pleasantly surprised, however, when the
door was opened by Emily, who smiled at him out
of shy blue eyes, and stood waiting to see what he
wanted. It was like expecting a viper and finding
a flower. Somehow he had not anticipated anything
flower-like in Jane's family. The mother, too, was
a surprise when she came from her ironing, and,
pushing her wavy gray hair back from a furrowed
brow lifted intelligent eyes that reminded him of
Jane, to search his face. Ma did not appear flustered.
She seemed to be taking account of him and
deciding whether or not she would be cordial to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had a telegram from Jane this morning,"
she was scanning his eyes once more to
see whether there was a shadow of what she
called "shiftiness" in them. "Come in," she
added grudgingly.</p>

<p>He was not led into the dining-room, but seated
on one of the best varnished chairs in the "parlor,"
as they called the little unused front room. He felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
strangely ill at ease and began to be convinced that
he was on the very wildest of wild goose chases. To
think of expecting to find Elizabeth Stanhope in a
place like this! If she ever had been here she certainly
must have flown faster than she had from the
church on her wedding night.</p>

<p>So, instead of beginning as he had planned, to
put a list of logically prepared keen questions to a
floundering and suspecting victim, he found the clear
eyes of Ma looking into his unwaveringly and the
wise tongue of Ma putting him through a regular
orgy of catechism before she would so much as admit
that she had ever heard of a girl named Lizzie Hope.
Then he bethought him of her daughter's letter and
handed it over for her to read.</p>

<p>"Well," she admitted at last, half satisfied, "she
isn't here at present. I sent her away when I found
you was comin'. I wasn't sure I'd let you see her at
all if I didn't like your looks."</p>

<p>"That's right, Mrs. Carson," he said heartily,
with real admiration in his voice. "I'm glad she has
some one so careful to look out for her. Your
daughter said she was in a good safe place, and I
begin to see she knew what she was talking about."</p>

<p>Then the strong look around Ma's lips settled
into the sweeter one, and she sent Bob after the girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you a friend of hers?" she asked, watching
him keenly.</p>

<p>"No," said Reyburn. "I've never seen her but
once. She doesn't know me at all."</p>

<p>"Are you a friend of her&mdash;family?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Or any of her friends or relations?" Ma meant
to be comprehensive.</p>

<p>"No. I'm sorry I am not. I am a rather
recent comer to the city where she made her home,
I understand."</p>

<p>Ma looked at him thoughtfully for a moment.
It wouldn't have been called a stare, it was too
kindly for that, but Reyburn thought to himself
that he would not have liked to have borne her
scrutiny if he had anything to conceal, for he felt
as if she might read the truth in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;please excuse me for askin'&mdash;but are
you a member of any church?"</p>

<p>Reyburn flushed, and wanted to laugh, but was
embarrassed in spite of himself:</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;I'm a member," he said slowly,
then with a frank lifting of his eyes to her troubled
gaze, "I united with the church when I was a mere
kid, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a member. I
really am not what you'd call 'working' at it much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
nowadays. I go to morning service sometimes, but
that's about all. I don't want to be a hypocrite."</p>

<p>He wondered as he spoke why he took the trouble
to answer the woman so fully. Her question was in
a way impertinent, much like the way her daughter
talked. Yet she seemed wholly unconscious of it.</p>

<p>"I know," she assented sorrowfully. "There's
lots of them in the church. We have 'em, too, even
in our little village. But still, after all, you can't
help havin' confidence more in them that has 'named
the name' than in them that has not."</p>

<p>Reyburn looked at her curiously and felt a sudden
infusion of respect for her. She was putting the test
of her faith to him, and he knew by the little stifled
sigh that he had been found wanting.</p>

<p>"I s'pose lawyers don't have much time to think
about being Christians," she apologized for him.</p>

<p>He felt impelled to be frank with her:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't urge that excuse. Unfortunately
I have a good deal of time on my hands now.
I've just opened my office and I'm waiting for clients."</p>

<p>"Where were you before that? You did not
just get through studying?"</p>

<p>He saw she was wondering whether he was wise
enough to help her protege.</p>

<p>"No, I spent the last three years in France."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Up at the front?" The pupils of her eyes
dilated eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, in every drive," he answered, wondering
that a woman of this sort should be so interested
now that the war was over.</p>

<p>"And you came back safe!" she said slowly,
looking at him with a kind of wistful sorrow in her
eyes. "My boy was shot the first day he went over
the top."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," said Reyburn gently, a sudden
tightness in his throat.</p>

<p>"But it was all right." She flashed a dazzling
smile at him through the tears that came into her
eyes. "It wasn't as if he wasn't ready. Johnny
was always a good boy, an' he joined church when he
was fourteen, an' always kep' his promises. He used
to pray every night just as faithful, an' read his
Bible. I've got the little Testament he carried all
through. His chaplain sent it to me. It's got a bullet
hole through it, and blood-marks, but it's good to me
to look at, 'cause I know Johnny's with his Saviour.
He wasn't afraid to die. He said to me before he
left, he says: 'Ma, if anythin' happens to me it's all
right. You know, Ma, I ain't forgettin' what you
taught me, an' I ain't forgettin' Christ is with me.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson wiped her eyes furtively, and tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to look cheerful. Reyburn wished he knew how to
comfort her.</p>

<p>"It makes a man feel mean," he said at last, trying
to fit his toe into the pattern of the ingrain carpet,
"to come home alive and whole when so many
poor fellows had to give their lives. I've often wondered
how I happened to get through."</p>

<p>She looked at him tenderly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps your Heavenly Father brought you
back to give you more chance to do things for Him,
an' get ready to die when your time comes."</p>

<p>There was something startling to this self-composed
city chap in hearing a thing like this from the
lips of the mother whose beloved son was gone forever
beyond her teaching but had "been ready."
Reyburn looked at her steadily, soberly, and then
with a queer constriction in his throat he looked
down at the floor thoughtfully and said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps He did."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help bein' glad you're a church
member, anyhow," said Mrs. Carson, rising to look
out of the window. "She needs a Christian to help
her, an' I'd sooner trust a Christian. If you really
meant it when you joined church you've got somethin'
to fall back on anyhow. Here she comes. I'll
just go an' tell her you're in here."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>, her eyes wide with fear, her face white
as a lily, appeared like a wraith at the parlor door and
looked at him. It gave Reyburn a queer sensation,
as if a picture one had been looking at in a story
book should suddenly become alive and move and
stare at one. As he rose and came forward he still
seemed to see like a dissolving view between them the
little huddled bride on the floor of the church. Then
he suddenly realized that she was trembling.</p>

<p>"Please don't be afraid of me, Miss Stanhope,"
he said gently. "I have only come to help you, and
if after you have talked with me you feel that you
would rather I should have nothing to do with your
affairs I will go away and no one in the world shall
be the wiser for it. I give you my word of honor."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Betty, toppling into a chair near
by. "I&mdash;guess&mdash;I'm not afraid of you. I just
didn't know who you might be&mdash;&mdash;!" She stopped,
caught her breath and tried to laugh, but it ended
sorrily, almost in a sob.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't wonder," said Reyburn, trying to
find something reassuring to say. "The truth is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
I was rather upset about you. I didn't quite know
who you might turn out to be, you see!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Betty's hand slipped up to her throat,
and her lips quivered as she tried to smile.</p>

<p>"Please don't feel that way," he said, "or I'll
go away at once." He was summoning all his courage
and hoping she wasn't going to break down and
cry. How little she was, and sweet! Her eyes
pleaded, just as they did in that one look in the
church. How could anybody be unkind to her?</p>

<p>"I'm quite all right," said Betty with a forced
smile, siting up very straight.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better introduce myself," he said,
trying to speak in a very commonplace tone. "I'm
just a lawyer that your friend Miss Jane Carson sent
out to see if I could be of any service to you. It
may possibly make things a little easier for you if
I explain that while I never had heard of you before,
and have no possible connection with your family or
friends, I happened to be at your wedding!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Betty with a little agonized breath.</p>

<p>"Do you know Mrs. Bryce Cochrane?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Betty could not have got any whiter, but her
eyes seemed to blanch a trifle.</p>

<p>"A little," she said in a very small voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, she is my cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Betty again.</p>

<p>"Her husband was unable to accompany her to
the wedding, and so I went in his place to escort
Isabel. I knew nothing of your affairs either before
or after the wedding, until this announcement was
brought to my notice, and Miss Carson called on me."</p>

<p>Betty took the paper in her trembling fingers,
and looked into her own pictured eyes. Then everything
seemed to swim before her for a moment. She
pressed her hand against her throat and set her white
lips firmly, looking up at the stranger with a sudden
terror and comprehension.</p>

<p>"You want to get that five thousand dollars!"
she said, speaking the words in a daze of trouble.
"Oh, I haven't got five thousand dollars! Not
now! But perhaps I could manage to get it if you
would be good enough to wait just a little, till I can
find a way. Oh, if you knew what it means to me!"</p>

<p>Warren Reyburn sprang to his feet in horror, a
flame of anger leaping into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars be hanged!" he said
fiercely. "Do I look like that kind of a fellow? It
may seem awfully queer to you for an utter stranger
to be butting into your affairs like this unless I did
have some ulterior motive, but I swear to you that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
I have none. I came out here solely because I
saw that you were in great likelihood of being found
by the people from whom you had evidently run
away. Miss Stanhope, I stood where I could watch
your face when you came up the aisle at your wedding,
and something in your eyes just before you
dropped made me wish I could knock that bridegroom
down and take care of you somehow until
you got that hurt look out of your face. I know it
was rather ridiculous for an utter stranger to presume
so far, but when I saw that the sleuths were
out after you, and when the knowledge of your
whereabouts was put into my hands without the
seeking, I wouldn't have been a man if I hadn't
come and offered my services. I'm not a very great
lawyer, nor even a very rising one, as your Miss Carson
seems to think, but I'm a man with a soul to
protect a woman who is in danger, and if that's you,
I'm at your service. If not, you've only to say so
and I'll take the next train home and keep my
mouth shut!"</p>

<p>He took his watch out and looked at it hastily,
although he had not the slightest idea what it registered,
nor what time the next train for home left.
He looked very tall and strong and commanding as
he stood in his dignity waiting for her answer, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Betty looked up like a little child and trusted him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Please forgive me!" she cried. "I've
been so frightened ever since Bob came after me. I
couldn't think you had come for any good, because
I didn't know any one in the world who would want
to help me."</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Warren Reyburn with a lump
in his throat, sitting down quickly to hide his emotion.
"Please consider me a friend, and command
me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Betty taking a deep breath
and trying to crowd back the tears. "I'm afraid
there isn't any way to help me, but I'm glad to have
a friend, and I'm sorry I was so rude."</p>

<p>"You weren't rude, and that was a perfectly
natural conclusion from my blundering beginning,"
he protested, looking at the adorable waves of hair
that framed her soft cheeks. "But there is always
a way to help people when they are in trouble, and
I'm here to find out what it is. Do you think you
could trust me enough to tell me what it's all about?
Miss Carson didn't seem to know much or else she
didn't feel free to say."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell her much," said Betty, lifting her
sea-blue eyes. "She was a stranger, too, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, she's a mighty good friend of yours, I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
say, and she's acted in a very wise manner. She
took more precautions than an old detective would
have done. She told me only that some one was
trying to make you marry a man you did not wish to
marry. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>Betty shivered involuntarily and a wave of color
went over her white face.</p>

<p>"It sounds queer," she said, "as if I hadn't any
character or force myself, but you don't understand.
No one would understand unless they knew it all,
and had been through it for years. At first I didn't
quite understand it myself. I'd better tell you the
story. I thought I never could tell any one, because
they were my father's family, and I know he would
shrink so from having it known, but I'm sure he
wouldn't blame me now."</p>

<p>"He certainly would not blame you, Miss Stanhope.
I have heard that your father was a wonderful
man, with high principles. I feel sure he would
justify you in appealing to some one who was willing
to advise you in a strait like this. You know no
woman need ever marry any man against her will."</p>

<p>"Not if it were her father's dying wish?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Miss Stanhope, did your father
love you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure he did. He was the most wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
father! I've often thought that he would never
have asked it of me if he had realized&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he ever during his lifetime seem to wish
you to be unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Never! That was the strange part of it. But
you see he didn't know how I felt. I think I'd better
tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"That would be the better way, if it won't be
too hard for you."</p>

<p>Betty clasped her small hands together tightly
and began:</p>

<p>"My own mother died when I was quite a little
girl, so father and I were a great deal to each other.
He used to look after my lessons himself, and was
always very careful what kind of teachers I had. He
was mother and father both to me. When I was
ten years old my governess died suddenly while
father was away on a business trip, and one of our
neighbors was very kind to me, coming in and looking
after the servants and everything and keeping
me over at her house for a few days till father got
back. She had a widowed sister visiting her, a
rather young woman who was very beautiful. At
least I thought she was beautiful then, and she made
a great pet of me, so that I grew fond of her, although
I had not liked her at first.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"After father came home she used to slip over
every day to see me while he was at his business, and
he was grateful to her for making me happy. Then
he found out that she was in trouble, had lost her
money or something, and wanted to get a position
teaching. He arranged to have her teach me, and so
she came to our house to stay.</p>

<p>"Somehow after that I never seemed to see so
much of my father as I used to do, for she was always
there, but at first I didn't care, because she was nice
to me, and always getting up things to keep me busy
and happy. She would make my father buy expensive
toys and books and games for me, and fine
clothes, and so of course I was pleased. In about
a year my father married her, and at first it seemed
very beautiful to me to have a real mother, but little
by little I began to see that she preferred to be alone
with my father and did not want me around so much.
It was very hard to give up the companionship of
my father, but my stepmother kept me busy with
other things, so that I really didn't think much about
it while it was first happening.</p>

<p>"But one day there came a letter. I remember
it came while we were at breakfast, and my father got
very white and stern when he read it, and handed it
over to my mother and asked whether it was true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and then she began to cry and sent me from the table.
I found out a few days after that that my stepmother
had two sons, both older than myself, and that she
had not told my father. It was through some
trouble they had got into at school which required
quite a large sum of money to cover damages that
my father discovered it, and he was terribly hurt
that she should have concealed it from him. I
learned all this from the servants, who talked when
they thought I was not within hearing. There were
days and days when my father scarcely spoke at the
table, and when he looked at me it made a pain go
through my heart, he looked so stern and sad. My
stepmother stayed a great deal in her room and
looked as if she had been crying. But after a few
weeks things settled down a good deal as they had
been, only that my father never lost that sad troubled
look. There was some trouble about my stepmother's
sons, too, for there was a great deal of argument
between her and my father, of which I only heard
snatches, and then one day they came home to stay
with us. Something had happened at the school
where they were that they could not stay any longer.
I can remember distinctly the first night they ate
dinner with us. It seemed to me that it was like a
terrific thunderstorm that never quite broke. Everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was trying to be nice and polite, but underneath
it all there was a kind of lightning of all kinds
of feelings, hurt feelings and wrong ones and right
ones all mixed up.</p>

<p>"Only the two boys didn't seem to feel it much.
They sort of took things for granted, as if that had
always been their home, and they didn't act very
polite. It seemed to trouble my father, who looked
at them so severely that it almost choked me, and I
couldn't go on eating my dinner. He didn't seem
like my dear father when he looked like that. I
always used to watch my father, and he seemed to
make the day for me. If he was sad, then I was sad;
and if he was glad then I was happy all over, until
one day my stepmother noticed me and said: 'See,
dear little Elizabeth is trembling. You ought not to
speak that way before her, Charles.' And then father
looked at me, and all suddenly I learned to smile
when I didn't feel like it. I smiled back to him just
to let him know it didn't matter what he did, I
would love him anyhow!"</p>

<p>During the recital Reyburn had sat with courteous
averted gaze as though he would not trouble
her with more of his presence than was absolutely
necessary. Now he gave her a swift glance.</p>

<p>Betty's eyes were off on distance, and she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
talking from the depths of her heart, great tears
welling into her eyes. All at once she remembered
the stranger:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, and brushed her
hand across her eyes. "I haven't gone over it to
any one ever, and I forgot you would not be interested
in details."</p>

<p>"Please don't mind me. I am interested in every
detail you are good enough to give me. It all makes
the background of the truth, you know, and that is
what I am after," said Reyburn, deeply touched.
"I think you are wonderful to tell me all this. I
shall regard it most sacredly."</p>

<p>Betty flashed a look of gratitude at him, and
noticed the sympathy in his face. It almost unnerved
her, but she went on:</p>

<p>"The oldest boy was named Bessemer, and he
wasn't very good-looking. He was very tall and
awkward, and always falling over things. He had
little pale eyes, and hardly any chin. His teeth
projected, too, and his hair was light and very
straight and thin. His mother didn't seem to love
him very much, even when he was a little boy. She
bullied him and found fault with him continually,
and quite often I felt very sorry for him, although I
wasn't naturally attracted to him. He wasn't really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
unpleasant to me. We got along very nicely,
although I never had much to do with him. There
wasn't much to him.</p>

<p>"The other brother, Herbert, was handsome like
his mother, only dark, with black curly hair, black
wicked eyes, and a big, loose, cruel mouth. His
mother just idolized him, and he knew it. He could
make her do anything on earth. He used to force
Bessemer into doing wrong things, too, things that
he was afraid to do himself, because he knew father
would not be so hard on Bessemer as on him. For
father had taken a great dislike to Herbert, and it
was no wonder. He seemed to have no idea at all
that he was not owner of the house. He took anything
he pleased for his own use, even father's most
sacred possessions, and broke them in a fit of anger,
too, sometimes, without ever saying he was sorry.
He talked very disrespectfully of father and to him,
and acted so to the servants that they gave notice
and left. Every few days there would be a terrible
time over something Herbert had done. Once I remember
he went to the safe and got some money out
that belonged to father and went off and spent it in
some dreadful way that made father very angry. Of
course I was still only a little girl, and I did not know
all that went on. Father was very careful that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
should not know. He guarded me more than ever,
but he always looked sad when he came to kiss
me good-night.</p>

<p>"Herbert took especial delight in tormenting
me," she went on with a sad far-away look in her
eyes as if she were recalling unpleasant memories.
She did not see the set look on Reyburn's face nor
notice his low exclamation of anger. She went
steadily on: "He found out that I did not like June-bugs,
and once he caught hundreds of them and
locked me into a room with them with all the lights
turned on. I was almost frightened to death, but it
cured me of being afraid of June-bugs." A little
smile trembled out on Betty's lips. "Just because
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of letting him
hear me scream." She finished. "Then he caught a
snake and put it in my room, and he put a lot of
burdocks in my hat so they would get in my hair.
Foolish things those were, of course, but he was a
constant nightmare to me. Sometimes he would tie
a wire across the passages in the upper hall where I
had to pass to my room, and when I fell my hands
went down against a lot of slimy toads in the dark,
for he always somehow managed to have the light go
out just as I fell. There were hundreds of things
like that, but I needn't multiply them. That's the
kind of boy he was. And because he discovered that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
my father loved me very much, and because he knew
my father disliked him, he spent much time in trying
to torment me in secret. I couldn't tell my father,
because he always looked so sad whenever there was
trouble, and there was sure to be trouble between him
and my stepmother if my father found out that Herbert
had done anything wrong. One day my father
came upon us just as Herbert had caught me and
was trying to cut my curls off. I didn't care about
the curls, but I knew my father did. I began to
scream. Herbert gripped me so I thought I would
die with the pain, putting his big strong fingers
around my throat and choking me so I could not
make any noise."</p>

<p>Reyburn clenched his hands until the knuckles
went white and uttered an exclamation, but Betty
did not notice:</p>

<p>"There was a terrible time then, and I was sent
away to a school, a good many miles from home,
where I stayed for several years. Father always
came up to see me every week end, for a few hours at
least, and we had wonderful times together. Sometimes
in vacation he would bring my stepmother
along and she would bring me beautiful presents and
smile and pet me, and say she missed me so much
and she wished I would ask my father to let me come
back and go to school in the city. But I never did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
because I was afraid of Herbert. As I grew older
I used to have an awful horror of him. But finally
one vacation father and mother both came up and
said they wanted me at home. My stepmother went
to my room with me and told me I needn't be afraid
of Herbert any more, that he was quite grown up and
changed and would be good to me, and that it would
please my father to have all his family together happily
again. I believed her and I told father I would
like to go. He looked very happy, and so I went
home. Herbert had been away at school himself
most of the time, and so had Bessemer, although they
had been in trouble a good many times, so the servants
told me, and had to change to new schools.
They were both away when I got home. I had
a very happy time for three weeks, only that I never
saw father alone once. My stepmother was always
there. But she was kind and I tried not to mind.
Then all of a sudden one night I woke up and heard
voices, and I knew that the boys were back from
the camp to which they had been sent. I didn't sleep
much the rest of the night, but in the morning I made
up my mind that it was only a little while before I
could go back to school, and I would be nice to the
boys and maybe they wouldn't trouble me.</p>

<p>"I found that it was quite true that Herbert had
grown up and changed. He didn't want to torment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
me any more, he wanted to make love to me, and I
was only a child yet. I wasn't quite fifteen. It filled
me with horror, and after he had caught me in the
dark&mdash;he always loved to get people in the dark&mdash;and
tried to kiss me, I asked father to let me go
back to school at once. I can remember how sad he
looked at me as if I had cut him to the heart when
I asked him."</p>

<p>During this part of the tale Reyburn sat with
stern countenance, his fingers clenched around the
arms of the chair in which he sat, but he held himself
quiet and listened with compressed lips, watching
every expression that flitted across the sweet
pale face.</p>

<p>"That was the last time I was at home with my
father," she said, trying to control her quivering
lips. "He took me back to school, and he came three
times to see me, though not so often as before. The
last time he said beautiful things to me about trying
to live a right life and being kind to those about me,
and he asked me to forgive him if he had ever done
anything to hurt me in any way. Of course I said he
hadn't. And then he said he hoped I wouldn't feel
too hard at him for marrying again and bringing
those boys into my life. I told him it was all
right, that some day they would grow up and go
away and he and I would live together again! And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he said some awful words about them under his
breath. But he asked me to forgive him again and
kissed me and went away.</p>

<p>"He was taken very sick when he got home, and
they never let me know until he was dead. Of
course I went home to the funeral, but I didn't stay;
I couldn't. I went back to school alone. My stepmother
had been very kind, but she said she knew
it was my father's wish that I should finish my
school year. When vacation came she was traveling
for her health. She wrote me a beautiful letter
telling me how she missed me, and how much she
needed me now in her bereavement, and how she
hoped another summer would see us together; but
she stayed abroad two years and the third year she
went to California. I was sent to another school,
and because I was not asked about it and there didn't
seem anything else to do, I went. Every time I
would suggest doing something else my stepmother
would write and say how sorry she was she could
not give her consent, but my father had left very
explicit directions about me and she was only trying
to carry out his wishes. She knew me well enough
to be sure I would want to do anything he wished
for me. And I did, of course."</p>

<p>Reyburn gave her a look of sympathy and getting
up began to pace the little room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> was not until last spring that she sent for me
to come home," went on Betty, "and was very effusive
about how much she needed me and how she
was so much better, and meant to be a real mother
to me now, helping me see the world and have a
good time. She took me from one summer resort
to another. Of course it was pleasant after having
been shut up in school all those years, but she kept me
close with her all the time, and I met only the people
she chose to have me meet. All the time she kept
talking about 'dear Herbert' and telling how wonderful
he was and how he had grown to be 'such a
dear boy.' Finally he arrived and began the very
first evening he was with us to coax me to marry him.
At first he was very courteous and waited upon
me whenever I stirred, and I almost thought his
mother was right about his being changed. But when
I told him that I did not love him and could not ever
marry him I caught a look on his face like an angry
snarl, and I heard him tell his mother I was a crazy
little fool, and that he would break my neck for me
after he got me good and married. Then his mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
began to come to me and cry and tell me how dear
Herbert was almost heart-broken, that he would
never lift up his head again, and that I would send
him to ruin. It was simply awful, and I didn't know
how to endure it. I began to wonder where I could
go. Of course I had never been brought up to do
anything, so I could not very well expect to go out
into the world and make my living."</p>

<p>"Didn't you have any money at all?" interrupted
Reyburn suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, looking up as if she had just
remembered his presence. "I had always plenty of
spending money, but if I went away where they
couldn't find me, why, of course, I would have to
give that up."</p>

<p>"Why, where did your money come from? Was
it an allowance from your stepmother, or did your
father leave it to you, or what?"</p>

<p>"I'm not just sure," said Betty, with troubled
brow. "I never really knew much about the money
affairs. When I asked, they always put me off and
said that I was too young to be bothered with business
yet, I would be told all about it when I came
of age. My stepmother harped a great deal on keeping
me young as long as possible. She said it was
my father's wish that I should be relieved of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
care until I came of age. But there were some trustees
in Boston. I know that, because I had to write
to them, about once or twice a year. My stepmother
was most particular about that. I think they were old
friends of my own mother, though I don't know
when I learned that. Father told me once that
mother had left me enough to keep me comfortably
even without what he would leave me, so I'm sure
I shall have enough to repay you if I could once
get it."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me!" he exclaimed. "It
seems so terrible for you to have been alone in a
situation like that! Wasn't there any one you could
appeal to for help?"</p>

<p>"No, not any one whom I thought it would be
right to tell. You see, in a way it was my father's
honor. She was his wife, and I'm sure he loved her&mdash;at
least at first&mdash;and she really was very good to
me, except when it was a question of her son."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't agree with you there!" he
said sternly. "I think she was a clever actress. But
excuse me. Go on, please."</p>

<p>"At last, when things had got so bad that I thought
I must run away somewhere, my stepmother came
into my room one morning and locked the door. She
had been weeping, and she looked very sweet and pitiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
She said she had something to tell me. She
had tried not to have to do it, for she was afraid it
would grieve me and might make me have hard
feelings against my father. I told her that was impossible.
Then she told me that my father on his
deathbed had called her to him and told her that
it was his wish that I should marry one of her sons,
and he wanted her to tell me. He felt that he had
wronged them by hating them for my sake and he
felt that I could make it all right by marrying one of
them. My stepmother said that when she saw how
infatuated dear Herbert was with me she hoped that
she would be spared having to tell me, but now that I
was treating him so she felt bound to deliver the
message. Then she handed me a paper which said
virtually the same thing which she had told me,
and was signed by my father in his own
handwriting."</p>

<p>"Was the paper written or printed?" interrupted
Reyburn.</p>

<p>"I think it was typewritten, but the signature
was papa's. There could be no mistake about that,
and he wouldn't have signed something he didn't
mean." Betty sighed as if it were a subject she had
worn into her heart by much sorrowful thought.</p>

<p>"It might be quite possible for him to have done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that under influence or delirium, or when he was
too sick to realize."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so?" Betty caught at the hope.
"It seems so awful to go against papa's last request."</p>

<p>"There is nothing awful but the idea of your
being tied to that&mdash;beast!" said Reyburn with unexpected
fervor. Betty looked at him gratefully and
went on:</p>

<p>"I was simply appalled. I couldn't think, and I
made my stepmother go away and leave me for a
little while, but things got blacker and blacker and
I thought I was going crazy. I couldn't marry Herbert
even to please my father. The next day
Bessemer arrived. He had been worrying his mother
a lot about money, and when he arrived I couldn't
help hearing what they said to him. They charged
him with all sort of dreadful things. They called
him a disgrace, and threatened to let him be arrested,
and a great many more such things. Finally his
mother ended up by telling him she never had loved
him and that if he made any more trouble about
money she would cut him off without a cent. I was
sitting upstairs in my room with my windows open,
and all their talk floated right up to me. It made
me feel sick, and yet I felt sorry for Bessemer, for
lately whenever he had been around he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
kind to me, and sometimes I had stayed near him
to get rid of Herbert. We often talked over our
troubles together and sympathized with one another.
He felt sorry for me, but he was weak himself and
couldn't see any way out for either of us.</p>

<p>"They had pretty stormy times all that day.
Late in the afternoon Herbert and Bessemer went to
their mother's room and were closeted with her for
two hours, after which Herbert went away in the car
with his suitcase and bags as if he were not coming
back soon. I watched him from my window, and in
great relief went down to take a little walk, for I had
stayed closely in my room all day trying to plan
what to do. One thing that held me from running
away was that it would be such a disgrace to the
family, and I knew my father would have felt it so
keenly. That was always the great trouble when the
boys got into scrapes at college, my father would
groan and say he felt disgraced to be so conspicuous
before the world. So I hesitated to do what would
have been a sorrow to him had he been alive.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later I was sitting alone in the
twilight on one of the porches, and Bessemer came
out and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>"He looked so sort of homely and lonesome that
I put my hand on his arm and told him I was awfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sorry for him, and suddenly he turned around
and said:</p>

<p>"'Say, Betty, why don't you marry <i>me?</i> Then
they can't say a word to either of us. Your father's
wishes will be carried out and Herb'll have to whistle.'</p>

<p>"At first I was horrified, but we talked a long
time about it, and he told me how lonely he had
always been, and how nobody had ever loved him,
and he knew he wasn't attractive, and all that; and
then he said that if I married him we would go away
and live by ourselves and he would let me do just
as I wanted to. He wouldn't bother me about anything.
If I didn't love him he would keep out of my
sight, and things like that, till I got very sorry for
him, and began to think that perhaps after all it was
the best thing that would ever come for either of
us. So I said I would.</p>

<p>"It surprised me a little that my stepmother took
it so calmly when we told her. She cried a little, but
did it very prettily, and kissed Bessemer, and told
him he was fortunate. Then she kissed me and said
I was a darling, and that she would be so happy
if it only weren't for poor dear Herbert.</p>

<p>"But after that they began to rush things for a
grand wedding, and I let them do it because I didn't
see anything else in the world for me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty raised her eyes and encountered the clear
grave gaze of Reyburn fixed on her, and the color
flew into her cheeks:</p>

<p>"I know you think I'm dreadful," she said,
shrinking. "I've thought so myself a thousand
times, but truly I didn't realize then what an awful
thing it would be to marry a man I didn't love. I
only wanted to hurry up and get it done before Herbert
came home. They said he had been called away
by important business and might be at home any
day. I gave my consent to everything they wanted
to do, and they fixed it all just as they pleased. One
thing that happened upset me terribly. When the
wedding invitations came home my stepmother carried
them off to her room. I was too sad to pay
much attention anyway. But the next morning I
happened to be down in the kitchen looking over the
papers that the maid had taken down from the waste
baskets to search for a missing letter and there in
the pile I found one of the invitations partly addressed
and flung aside, and the invitation was still
in the envelope. I pulled it out with a ghastly kind
of curiosity to see how I looked on paper, and there
it read, Mrs. Charles Garland Stanhope invites you
to be present at the marriage of her daughter Elizabeth
to <i>Mr. Herbert Hutton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>!</i></p>

<p>"My heart just stood still. With the paper in
my hand I rushed up to my stepmother's room and
demanded to know what that meant. She smiled
and said she was so sorry I had been annoyed that
way, that that was a mistake, the invitations had
come wrongly engraved and she had had to send
them back and have them done over again. She
was afraid I might be superstitious about it, so she
hadn't told me. She was very gentle and sweet and
tried to soothe me, and called me 'Betty,' the name
my father always had for me, and at last I went back
to my room feeling quite comfortable. She had said
she always felt troubled for poor Bessemer, that nobody
could love him right, he was so homely, and
now I was going to make everything right by marrying
him. She was going to try to forget what I
had done to poor dear Herbert, and just be happy
about Bessemer. She talked so nicely that I kissed
her, a thing I hadn't done in years, not since she was
first married to father. But somehow the shock of
seeing Herbert's name on the invitation stayed with
me, and I began to feel gloomier about it all and
to wonder if perhaps I had done right. The last
day I was terribly depressed and when I got to the
church that night it suddenly came to me that perhaps
after all I was not going to be free at all as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had hoped, but was just tying myself up to them all
for life. I was thinking that as I walked up the
aisle, and my throat had a big lump in it the way it
always does when I am frightened, and then I looked
up hoping a glimpse of poor Bessemer's face would
steady me and he wasn't there at all! And right
over me, waiting beside the minister, to marry me
stood <i>Herbert!</i> My knees just gave way under me,
and everything got black so I couldn't go on another
step, nor even stand up. I had to drop. I wasn't
unconscious as you all thought&mdash;I heard everything
that went on, but I couldn't do anything about it.</p>

<p>"After they had carried me into the other room
and given me things to drink, and I could get my
breath again I saw it all clearly. Herbert hadn't
given up at all. He meant to marry me anyway. He
had had the invitations printed with his name on
purpose and they probably hadn't been changed at
all. Everybody in that great church out there was
<i>expecting</i> me to marry Herbert Hutton, and I <i>was
not going to do it!</i> I didn't quite know how I was
going to stop it, but I knew I had to! You see I was
brought up to think a great deal about what people
would think of me if I did anything out of the
usual, and it seemed to me I had disgraced myself
forever by dropping down in the aisle. I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Herbert well enough to be sure he would carry that
wedding through now if he had to hold me up in
his arms till the ceremony was over, and I was
desperate. I would have given everything I had in
the world if the floor had opened and swallowed
me up then, but of course I knew wild thoughts
like that wouldn't get me anywhere, so I just shut
my eyes and tried to think of a way; and then I
asked them all to go out a minute and let me be quiet.
The doctor who had come out of the church told
them to go. I shall always bless that man, whoever
he was! Then when they were gone I opened a door
that had a key in it, and I locked it behind me and
ran away down some stairs and out a passage that led
to the street. That girl, Jane Carson, was passing
and she put her own coat on me and took me to her
room and sent me here. Oh, it's been so good to get
here! Do you think they can take me away against
my will?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said the young man. "Not
without some foul play, but I don't intend to give
them any chance for that. By the way, when do you
come of age?"</p>

<p>"In three weeks," said Betty, looking troubled.
"Why, would I be safe after I was of age?"</p>

<p>"You certainly would not be under their guardianship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
any longer," said the young lawyer, "and
they would have no right to control your actions, unless
of course you were incapacitated somehow and
unfit to manage your own affairs."</p>

<p>Betty looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I've thought sometimes, ever since I saw that
paper in which they hinted that I was temporarily
insane, that they might try to shut me up in an insane
asylum. Herbert wouldn't stop at anything. Could
he do that?"</p>

<p>"They would have to get a doctor to swear that
you were mentally unsound," said Reyburn, looking
troubled. "Does he really love you, do you think
or does he only want to get you in his power for
some reason?"</p>

<p>"It is more like that," said Betty sorrowfully,
"he couldn't really love anybody but himself."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you worry. I'm going at the case
at once, and I'll put those people where they'll have
to walk a chalk line before many hours are over. The
first thing I must do is to see those trustees of yours.
Can you give me the names and addresses?"</p>

<p>He got out his fountain pen, and Betty told him
all he wanted to know, that is, all she knew herself,
and then suddenly it was train time and he hurried
away. On the steps he paused and said in a low tone:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you perfectly comfortable with these people
for a few days until I can get you better accommodations
where you will be safe?"</p>

<p>"Entirely," said Betty eagerly. "I wouldn't
want to go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But it must be very hard for one like you to be
thrown constantly with illiterate, uncultured people."</p>

<p>Betty smiled dreamily:</p>

<p>"I don't think they are exactly uncultured," she
said slowly. "They&mdash;well, you see, they make a
friend of God, and somehow I think that makes a
difference. Don't you think it would?"</p>

<p>"I should think it would," said Warren Reyburn
reverently with a light in his eyes. "I think, perhaps,
if you don't mind my saying it, that you, too, have
been making a friend of God."</p>

<p>"I've been trying to," said Betty softly, with a
shy glow on her face that he remembered all the way
back to the city.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Candace Cameron</span> paced her little gabled room
restively, with face growing redder and more excited
at every step. For several weeks now she had
been virtually a prisoner&mdash;albeit a willing enough
one&mdash;in the house of Stanhope. But the time had
come when she felt that she must do something.</p>

<p>She had gone quietly enough about a proscribed
part of the house, doing little helpful things, making
herself most useful to the madam, slipping here
and there with incredible catlike tread for so plump
a body, managing to overhear important conversations,
and melting away like a wraith before her
presence was discovered. She had made herself so
unobtrusive as to be almost forgotten by all save
the maid Marie, who had been set to watch her;
and she had learned that if she went to bed quite
early in the evening, Marie relaxed her watch and
went down to the servants' quarters, or even sometimes
went out with a lover for a while, that is, if the
madam herself happened to be out also. On several
such occasions she had made valuable tours of
investigation through the madam's desk and private
papers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>That she was overstepping her privileges as a
servant in the house went without saying, but she
silenced her Scotch conscience, which until this
period of her existence had always kept her strictly
from meddling with other people's affairs, by declaring
over and over again to herself that she was
doing perfectly right because she was doing it for
the sake of "that poor wee thing that was being
cheated of her rights."</p>

<p>Several weeks had passed since her sudden re-establishment
in the family, and the reports of Betty,
so hastily readjusted and refurbished to harmonize
with the newspaper reports, had not been any more
satisfying. Mrs. Stanhope had explained to the
servants the day after the excitement that Miss
Betty had become temporarily deranged, and later
that she had escaped from the private hospital where
she had been taken, and they were doing all in their
power to find her. In reply to Candace's gimlet-like
questions she had given the name of a hospital where
she said Betty had been taken at first, and everything
seemed altogether plausible. But as the days
went by and the horror of her absence grew into the
soul of the lonely woman whose care Betty had been
for years, Candace became more and more restive
and suspicious. It was these <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suspicians'">suspicions</ins> which sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
her on her investigations, and made her uncannily
wise to pry open secret locks and cover all trace of her
absence after she had gleaned what knowledge
she sought.</p>

<p>On this particular evening her excitement was
due to having come across some correspondence
bearing the signature of a man to whom a certain
letter had been addressed, which had been entrusted
to her charge by Betty's dying father and taken from
her by his wife. For years she had been worried
about that, and yet she had no absolute reason to
doubt that the madam had not sent it to its destination,
except as she knew its contents and read Mrs.
Stanhope's character beneath the excellent camouflage.
But to-night, even the briefest glance through
the bundle of letters showed plainly that those men
in Boston never knew the master's wishes, or at least,
if they knew them, they were utterly disregarding
them.</p>

<p>Aroused on one point, her suspicions began to
extend further. Where was Betty? Did her stepmother
know, and was she somewhere suffering,
alone, perhaps being neglected because she had not
done as they wanted her to do? If the stepmother
was capable of destroying a letter, was she perhaps
not also capable of putting Betty out of the way?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
There were points of detail which of course did not
harmonize with any such theory as this. Candace
was no logician, but she was keen enough to feel
that something was wrong. As for that theory of
Betty's insanity she scouted it with a harsh laugh
whenever it was mentioned in her hearing. Betty&mdash;keen,
sweet, trusting little Betty <i>insane!</i> Nonsense!
It was unthinkable. If she was in an asylum anywhere
she was there without warrant, and it behoved
her faithful old nurse to find a way out for her.
This she meant to do against all odds, for she was
thoroughly aroused now.</p>

<p>She went to the window and looked down into the
lighted street. Over there not four blocks away
rose the steeple of the church where Betty had gone
to be married! Around the corner was the great
brick pile of the hospital where her stepmother said
she had been taken from the church, and from
which she was believed by the other servants to
have escaped.</p>

<p>Standing thus looking out into the light-starred
city, Candace began to form a plan, her plump
tightly garmented chest rising and falling excitedly
as she thought it all out. It was up to her to find
out what had become of Betty. But how was she
to get away without being suspected? Somehow she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
must do it. She knew perfectly the address that
had been on that letter. She had written it down
carefully from memory as soon as it had been taken
away from her. She must go to Boston and find that
man to whom it had been written, and discover
whether he had ever received it. But she could not
go until she found out certainly whether or not Betty
had ever really escaped from the hospital. Who
knew but that she was shut up there yet, and the
madam telling this tale all about and advertising with
a five thousand dollar reward! In the movies, too!
Such a disgrace on the family! How the master
would have writhed at the publicity of his beloved
daughter&mdash;"poor wee thing!"</p>

<p>Candace turned from the window with her lips
set, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tiptoing'">tiptoeing</ins> to the door, listened. Yes, it was
Aileen who was coming lightly up the stairs, singing
in a low tone. It was Aileen's evening out. That
meant that Marie would be more than usually active
on the upper floor. She must manage it before
Aileen left and Marie was called upstairs, or there
would be no opportunity to get away without Marie
seeing her.</p>

<p>Hastily she gathered her silk dress, her cloak and
her apoplectic hat into a bundle with her purse and
her gloves, and tied them into an old apron, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
strings hanging free. Then stealthily opening the
window, she dropped them out into the kitchen
area below, close to the region of the ash cans. It
was a risk, of course, but one must take some chances,
and the servants would all be in the kitchen just now,
laughing and talking. They would scarcely have
heard it fall.</p>

<p>She listened a tense instant, then closed the window,
and possessing herself of a few little things,
gathered hastily about the room, which she could
stuff in her pockets, she opened her door softly,
closed it behind her, and trotted off down the stairs
just as if she were going about her ordinary duty.
Listening a minute outside the kitchen door she
slipped stealthily down the cellar stairs, and tiptoed
over to the area door where the ashman took out
the ashes. Softly slipping the bolt she opened the
door and drew in her bundle. Then standing within,
she quickly slipped the black silk over her housemaid's
gown, donned her coat and hat and gloves,
and sallied forth. A moment more and she was in
the next street with the consciousness that she
"might have done the like any time sooner, if she'd
wanted, in spite of that little spy-cat Marie."</p>

<p>"If I want to go back I'll just say I went after
my insurance book," she chuckled to herself as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sped down the street in the direction of the hospital.</p>

<p>Arrived at the big building she asked to see the
list of patients taken in on the day of Betty's wedding,
and succeeded in getting a pretty accurate
description of each one, sufficient at least to satisfy
her that Betty was not among them. Then she asked
a few more bold questions, and came away fully convinced
that Betty had never been in that hospital.</p>

<p>By this time it was nine o'clock, and she meant to
take the evening train for Boston, which left, she was
sure, somewhere near midnight. She took a trolley
to her old lodgings where she had been since Mrs.
Stanhope had sent her away the first time, and
hastily packed a small hand bag with a few necessities,
made a few changes in her garments, then went
to see a fellow lodger whom she knew well, and
where she felt sure she could easily get a check
cashed, for she had a tidy little bank account of her
own, and was well known to be reliable.</p>

<p>Having procured the necessary funds, she made
her way to the station and found that she had still
an hour to spare before the Boston train left.</p>

<p>Settled down at last in the back seat of a common
car, she made herself as comfortable as her surroundings
would allow, and gave herself up to planning
the campaign that was before her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Canny Candace did not go at once to the office
of the brothers, James and George McIntyre, though
she looked them up in the telephone book the very
first thing when the train arrived in Boston even
before she had had a bite to eat, and her cup of tea
which meant more to her than the "bite." She
reasoned that they would be busy in the early hours
and not be able to give her their undivided attention.
She had not lived out all her life for nothing. She
knew the ways of the world, and she had very
strict ideas about the best ways of doing everything.
So it happened that when she was at last shown
into the office of the McIntyres, Warren Reyburn
who had traveled to Boston on the sleeper of the
same train that she had taken the night before, was
just arising from an earnest conference with the
two men. With her first glance, as the three emerged
from the inner office, Candace saw that the two elder
gentlemen were much disturbed and it flitted through
her mind that she had come at an inopportune moment.
Then her quick eye took in the younger man
and her little alert head cocked to one side with a
questioning attitude. Where had she seen him before?
Candace had the kind of a mind that kept
people and events card-indexed even to the minutest
detail, and it didn't take many seconds for her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
place Warren Reyburn back in the church at the
wedding, standing against the wall with his arms
folded. She had noticed him particularly because
he was so courteous to a little old lady who came
in too late to get a seat. She had studied him as he
stood there, waiting for the wedding march, and
she had thought how handsome he looked and how
fine it would have been if her wee Betty had been
getting a man like that in place of the weak-faced
Bessemer Hutton. She had watched to see who
he was with, and felt deep satisfaction when she
noticed him lean over and speak to Mrs. Bryce
Cochrane as if he belonged to her. He wasn't her
husband, because she knew Mr. Cochrane, who had
been a favorite with Mr. Stanhope and much at the
house. This man might be Mrs. Cochrane's brother
"or the likes," and she had pleased herself watching
him till Betty arrived and took all her thoughts. So
now she stood with her little round head in its hectic
hat tilted interestedly to one side, watching, ears on
the keen to catch any word, for all the world like
a "bit brown sparrow" saucily perched on another
man's window, where it really had no right to be.</p>

<p>At last one of the McIntyre's shook hands gravely
with the younger man, and the other one attended
him to the door, talking in low tones. The McIntyre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
thus set at liberty, turned questioningly toward
the stranger, who was not slow in getting to
her feet and coming forward.</p>

<p>"You will maybe be Mr. James McIntyre?" she
asked, lifting her sea-blue eyes set in her apple-red
face, and fixing her firm little lips in dignity. Candace
was a servant and knew her place, but she felt
the importance of her mission, and meant to have
no disrespect done to it.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. George McIntyre," the gentleman
replied, and, indicating the man at the door, "Mr.
James McIntyre will be at liberty in a moment, but
perhaps I will do as well?"</p>

<p>Candace cocked a glance toward the elderly back
at the door; and then returned her look to
Mr. George:</p>

<p>"You'll maybe be knowing Mr. Charles Stanhope?"
she propounded, as if she were giving
him a riddle, and her blue eyes looked him through
and through:</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, surely! He was a very close friend!
You&mdash;knew him?"</p>

<p>"I was Miss Betty's nurse who cooked the griddle
cakes for you the morning after the funeral&mdash;&mdash;"
she said, and waited with breathless dignity to see
how he would take it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Is that so!" He beamed on her kindly.
"Yes, yes, I remember those cakes. They were delicious!
And what can I do for you? Just sit
down. Why, bless me, I don't know but that your
coming may be very opportune! Can you tell me
anything of Miss Betty?"</p>

<p>Candace pressed her lips together with a knowing
smile as much as to say she might tell volumes if it
were wise, and she cast a glance at the other brother
who was shaking hands now with his visitor and
promising to meet him a little later:</p>

<p>"Yon man'll be knowing a bit, too, I'll be thinking,"
she hazarded nodding toward Reyburn as he
left. "He was at the wedding, I'm most sure&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The elder McIntyre gave her a quick glance and
signalled to his brother to come near:</p>

<p>"This is Miss Stanhope's nurse, the one who
cooked breakfast for us at the time of the
funeral," he said, and to Candace, "This is
Mr. James McIntyre."</p>

<p>Candace fixed him with another of her inquisitive
little glances:</p>

<p>"I've some bit papers put by that I thought ye
might like to see," she said with a cautious air. "I've
kept them fer long because I thought they might be
wanted sometime, yet I've never dared bring them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to your notice before lest I would be considered
meddlin', and indeed I wasn't sure but you had them
already. Will you please to look over them papers
and see if you've ever seen them before?" She drew
forth an envelope from her bag and handed it to
them. "It's a bit letter that Mr. Stanhope wrote the
day he was dyin' an' then copied and give to me to
mail, and his lady took it away, sayin' she would
attend to it. What I want to know is, did ye ever
get the letter? If ye did it's all right and none of
my business further, an' I'll go on my way back home
again and think no more about it; but if ye didn't
then there it is, an' you ought to see it, that's sure!"</p>

<p>The two men drew eagerly together and studied
the trembling lines:</p>

<p>"It's his writing all right," murmured one,
under his breath, and the brother nodded gravely:</p>

<p>"You say that this was the original of a letter
that was given to you to mail to us?"</p>

<p>Candace nodded.</p>

<p>"It's what he wrote first, and got ink on it, an'
then wrote it over. I can't say what changes he
made, as I didn't read it, but this he gave to me to
burn, and before I gets it burned my lady comes in
and takes the letter from me while he was sleepin';
and so I hid the bit papers, thinkin' they might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
be a help to wee Betty sometime. And oh, can ye
tell me anything of my little Lady Betty? Is she
safe? Did she come to you for refuge? You needn't
be afraid to tell me. I'll never breathe a word&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The two brothers exchanged quick glances of
warning and the elder man spoke:</p>

<p>"My good woman, we appreciate your coming,
and these papers may prove very useful to us. We
hope to be able to clear up this matter of Miss Stanhope's
disappearance very soon. She did not come
to us, however, and she is not here. But if you will
step into the room just beyond and wait for a little
while we may be able to talk this matter over
with you."</p>

<p>Very courteously he ushered the plump, apprehensive
little woman into the next room and established
her in an easy leather chair with a quantity
of magazines and newspapers about her, but she kept
her little head cocked anxiously on one side, and
watched the door like a dog whose master has gone
in and shut the way behind him; and she never sat
back in her chair nor relaxed one iota during the
whole of the two hours that she had to wait before
she was called at last to the inner office where she
found the handsome young man whom she remembered
seeing at the wedding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>She presently found that Reyburn was as keen as
he was handsome, but if she hadn't remembered him
at the wedding as a friend of that nice Mrs. Cochrane,
she never would have made it as easy as she did
for him to find out things from her, for she could
be canny herself on occasion if she tried, and she did
not trust everybody.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mysterious disappearance of Candace from
the Stanhope house caused nothing short of a panic.
Herbert and his mother held hourly wrangles,
and frantically tried one thing and then another.
Day after day the responses came in from the advertisements
they had caused to be put forth. Everyone
was hot-foot for the reward, but so far little of
encouragement had been brought out. More and
more the young man was fixing his mind on the idea
that Candace had something to do with Betty's disappearance,
so he was leaving no stone unturned
to find the nurse as well as the girl. To this end
he insisted on seeing personally and cross-examining
every person who came claiming to have a clue to
the lost girl.</p>

<p>That morning, at about the same hour when Candace
walked into the office of the McIntyre Brothers
in Boston, James, the butler, much against his dignity,
was ushering a curious person into the presence
of the son of the house. James showed by every line
of his noble figure that he considered this duty beneath
his dignity, and that it was only because the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
occasion was unusual that he tolerated it for a moment,
but the man who ambled observantly behind
him, stretching his neck to see everything that was to
be seen in this part of the great house, that he might
tell about it at the fire-house, failed to get the effect.
He was wondering why in thunder such rich people
as these seemed to be, couldn't afford carpets big
enough to cover their whole floors, instead of just
having skimpy little bits of pieces dropped around
here and there, that made you liable to skid all over
the place if you stepped on one of them biasly.</p>

<p>Herbert Hutton lifted his head and watched
Abijah Gage slouch into the room. He measured
him keenly and remained silent while Abijah opened
up. There had been many other applicants for that
reward that day, with stories cunningly woven, and
facts, substantiated by witnesses, in one case a whole
family brought along to swear to the fabrication;
but as yet Herbert had not found a promising clue
to his missing bride, and the time was going by.
In a few days it would be too late, and his undisciplined
spirit raged within him. It was not only his
bride he wanted, it was her fortune, which was worth
any trouble he might take; and every day, every
hour, every minute now, it was slipping, slipping,
slipping from his eager grasp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Abijah was a little overawed in the presence of
this insolent man of the world, but he felt he had,
for almost the first time in his life, Truth on his side,
and he was strong in the power of it. With a cunning
equal to the one that matched him he dealt
out his information bit by bit, giving only enough at
a time to make his victim sure it was the real thing
this time; and then he halted stubbornly and would
say no more until that five thousand dollars was
signed and sealed over to him. They had a long
argument, but in the end Bi won, and was given
certain documents which he was satisfied would stand
in court. A little later the telephone in Reyburn's
office rang sharply, and when Jimmie Ryan responded
a voice that he had never heard before asked
for Mr. Warren Reyburn.</p>

<p>"He's out of town," Jimmie replied.</p>

<p>"How soon will he be back?" The voice was
like a snarl.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure. He's called to Boston on
business," swelled Jimmie loyally.</p>

<p>An oath ripped over the wire, and Jimmie raged
within and quailed. Was his idol then losing a
great case?</p>

<p>"He might be back in a few hours," insinuated
Jimmie. "Who shall I say called up if he should
have me over long distance?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"You needn't say anybody! I'll call up again,"
growled the voice, and the man hung up.</p>

<p>Jimmie sat for a long time in blissful reverie.
"He's getting there!" he whispered to himself.
"He'll get the big cases yet, and I can keep my first
place. I must see Jane to-night and tell her."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at Tinsdale improvements had
been going on at the Carsons'. Bob, always handy
with tools, had been putting in a tank over the bathtub.
They had one at the house on the hill, only it
was run by a windmill. Bob had a friend who was
a plumber's son, and from him had obtained some
lengths of second-hand water-pipe and an old faucet.
He had conceived the idea of a tank on the roof, and
his first plan had been only a rainwater tank, but
gradually as his vision widened he included a force
pump in the outfit of desires. He hung around the
plumber's until they unearthed an old force pump
somewhat out of repair, and for a few days' assisting
the plumber Bob acquired it, together with after-hour
help to put it into operation. The next object
was a tank, which seemed at first to represent the
impossible; but the grocer at last offered a suggestion
in the shape of several large empty hogsheads
which he readily accepted at the price of four Saturdays'
work in the store.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>All Bob's extra time was put into these improvements,
and he was as excited every night when it
grew dark and he was forced to come to supper
because he couldn't see any longer to work, as if he
had been building an airship.</p>

<p>The day the hogsheads were marshaled and connected
and the force pump sent its first stream into
them was a great occasion. The family assembled in
the yard, with Elise Hathaway, who had been
allowed to come over for a few minutes with Betty.
Bob and his plumber friend pumped, and Emily
climbed to the attic window, which overlooked the
row of hogsheads, ranged so that the water would
flow from one to the other, and acted as pilot to the
new enterprise. As the first stream from the force
pump, which Bob had lavishly painted red, crept
its way up the pipes and began to wet the bottom of
the first and highest hogshead Emily gave a little
squeal of delight and shouted "It's come! It's come!
The water's come!" and the family below fairly held
their breath with the wonder of it. Not that such a
thing could be, but that their own freckled, grinning
Bob should have been able to achieve it.</p>

<p>There was an elaborate system of tin conductors
which conveyed the waste water from the bathtub
out through a hole in the wall of the little laundry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
bathroom, and distributed it along the garden beds
wherever its controller desired to irrigate. Thus the
system became practical as well as a luxury. There
was also an arrangement of gutter pipes for carrying
off any surplus water from the hogsheads, so saving
the Carson house from possible inundation at any
time of heavy storms.</p>

<p>After the plumbing was finished Bob painted the
laundry neatly inside with beautiful white paint and
robin's-egg blue for the ceiling, and Betty told him it
almost made one think of going swimming in the
ocean. Next he began to talk about a shower bath.
Betty told him what one was like and he began to
spend more days down at the plumber's asking questions
and picking up odd bits of pipe, making measurements,
and doing queer things to an old colander
for experiment's sake. The day that Warren Reyburn
came for the first time Bob had the shower
part finished and ready to erect, and the next day
saw it complete with a rod for the rubber curtain
that Betty had promised to make for him. He and
she were planning how they would make further
improvements on the house before Jane and Nellie
should come home for their summer vacation week.
Betty had thoroughly entered into the life of the
little household now, and was a part of it. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
saved her own small wages, and grudged all she
had to spend for necessary clothes, that she might
contribute further to the comfort and beauty of
the general home.</p>

<p>After Warren Reyburn's visit the last barrier between
Betty and Ma seemed to be broken down. As
soon as she had closed the door she flew into the other
room and flung her arms around Ma's neck, bursting
into soft weeping on her motherly shoulder. Ma had
done a rapid turning act when she heard her coming,
for in truth she had been peeping behind the green
window-shade to watch the handsome stranger go
down the street, but she would have dropped the iron
on her foot and pretended to be picking it up rather
than let Betty suspect her interest in the visitor.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," she murmured in Mrs. Carson's
willing ear, "I have been so frightened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, dearie!" soothed the mother, quite as
if she had been her own. "I know!"</p>

<p>"But he was very kind," she said lifting her head
with an April effect of tears. "He's going to try to
fix things for me so that I don't need ever to be
afraid of any one making trouble for me any more.
You see, I sort of ran away. There was somebody I
was afraid of who troubled me a great deal."</p>

<p>"Yes, dearie, I thought as much," said Ma.
"Jane kind of gave me to understand there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
something like that. I'm real glad there's somebody
goin' to look into your affairs an' fix things right
for you. I knew you was restless an' worried. Now
it'll get all straightened out. He's got a nice face.
I trusted him first off. He's a church member, an'
that's somethin'. They ain't all spiritual, but they're
mostly clean an' just an' kindly, when they're anythin'
at all but just plain hypocrites, which, thank
the Lord, there ain't so many as some would have us
believe. Now wash your face, dearie, an' run back
to your place so you can come home early, for we're
goin' to have the old hen with dumplin's for supper
to celebrate."</p>

<p>That was one charming thing about that household:
they celebrated every blessed little trifle that
came into their lives, so that living with them was
like a procession of beautiful thanksgivings.</p>

<p>It was while Betty was eating the gala "hen,"
delicious in its festive gravy and dumplings, that she
looked off across the little dining-room to the dark
window with its twinkling village lights in the distance
and thought of the stranger. A dark fear
flashed across her sweet face and sparkled in the
depths of her eyes for just an instant. Was it perhaps
the distant bay of the hounds on her trail, coming
nearer every moment? Then she remembered
the heavenly Father and her new-found faith, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
turned back to the cheery little room and the children's
pleasant clatter, resolved to forget the fear
and to trust all to Him who cared for her. Perhaps
he had sent the pleasant stranger, and the thought
brought a quiet little smile to settle about her lips.
She laughed with Bob and Emily at how they had got
wet with a sudden unexpected shower from the new
bath while they were arranging the curtain on the rod,
and Emily had turned the faucet on without knowing
it. The patient-eyed mother watched them all and
was satisfied.</p>

<p>How good it is that we cannot hear all the noises
of the earth at the same time, nor know of every
danger that lurks near as we are passing by! We
grumble a great deal that God does not send us as
much as we think he might, but we give scarce a
thought to our escape from the many perils, lying
close as our very breath, of which we never
even dream.</p>

<p>At that moment, as they sat quietly eating their
happy meal, a deadly particular peril was headed
straight for Tinsdale.</p>

<p>Abijah Gage and Herbert Hutton boarded the
evening train for Tinsdale together and entered the
sleeper. Abijah shuffled behind, carrying the bags,
a most extraordinary and humiliating position for
him. He had never been known to carry anything,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not even himself if he could help it, since the day
his mother died and ceased to force him to carry
in wood and water for her at the end of a hickory
switch. He glanced uneasily round with a slight
cackle of dismay as he arrived in the unaccustomed
plush surroundings and tried to find some place to
dump his load. But the well-groomed Herbert strode
down the long aisle unnoticing and took possession
of the section he had secured as if he owned the road.</p>

<p>"You can sit there!" he ordered Bi with a
condescending motion, dropping into his own seat
and opening a newspaper.</p>

<p>Bi sat down on the edge of the seat, and held on
to the arm in a gingerly way as if he were afraid
to trust himself to anything so different. He looked
furtively up and down the car, eyed the porter, who
ignored him contemptuously and finally came back
and demanded his sleeper ticket with a lordliness
that Bi did not feel he could take from a negro. But
somehow the ticket got tangled in his pocket, and Bi
had a hard time finding it, which deepened his indignation
at the porter.</p>

<p>"I ain't takin' no sass from no one. My seat's
paid fer all right," he said distinctly for the enlightenment
of the other passengers, and Herbert Hutton
reached out a discreet arm and dropped something in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the porter's hand which sent him on his way and
left Bi snorting audibly after him.</p>

<p>"You'd better shut up!" growled the dictator to
Bi. "We don't want to be conspicuous, you know.
If you can't hold your tongue and act as if you had
ever traveled before, I'll get off this train at the next
station and you can whistle for your reward. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>Bi dropped his toothless lower jaw a trifle and
his little eyes grew narrow. This was no way to
manage affable Bi. He loved a good visit, and he had
counted on one all the way to Tinsdale. He had no
idea of sitting silent.</p>

<p>"I understand," he drawled, "an' I'll be gormed
ef I'll agree. I ain't told you yet where we get off,
an' I don't have to ef I don't wantta. Ef you can't
treat me like a gen'l'man you know where you can
get off, an' I ain't havin' to state it."</p>

<p>Herbert Hutton drew his arrogant brows in a
frown of annoyance, and whirled around to placate
his guide:</p>

<p>"Now see here, you old popinjay, what's got
into you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I ain't nobody's papa," babbled Bi,
seeing he had scored a point. "I have enough to do
to support myself without any family."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right, have it your own way, only
shut up or we'll have somebody listening. Have a
cigar. Take two. But you can't smoke 'em in here,
you'll have to go to the smoking-room. Wait! I'll
see if we can get the drawing-room."</p>

<p>The porter appeared and the change was effected,
to the great <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disapointment'">disappointment</ins> of Bi, who kept continually
poking his head out to get a glimpse of the fine
ladies. He would much have preferred staying out
in the main car and getting acquainted with people.
His cunning had departed with the need. He had
put things in the hands of this surly companion, and
now he meant to have a good time and something to
tell the gang about when he got home.</p>

<p>About midnight the train drew into a station and
Herbert Hutton roused himself and looked out of
the window. Bi, whose cunning had returned, followed
his example. Suddenly he leaned forward
excitedly and tapped the glass with a long finger:</p>

<p>"That's him! That's the guy," he whispered excitedly
as another train drew in and passengers
began to hurry down the platform and across to the
waiting sleeper.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Sartin!"</p>

<p>"You mean the one with the coat over his arm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and the two men behind?" He stopped short with
an exclamation.</p>

<p>Bi looked up cunningly. Now what was up? He
saw a thunder-cloud on the face of his companion.</p>

<p>With embellishments Herbert Hutton asked if Bi
had ever seen the two tall gray-haired men who were
walking with their prey.</p>

<p>Bi narrowed his eyes and denied any knowledge,
but perceived there were more sides than two to the
enigma. Now, what could he figure out of those
two guys? Were there more rewards to be offered?
If so, he was a candidate. He wondered what chance
there was of getting away from H. H. and sauntering
through the train. He found, however, a sudden
willingness on the part of his companion to vanish
and let him do the scout work for the rest of
the night.</p>

<p>With a sense of being on a vacation and a chance
at catching big fish Bi swung out through the train.
Bumping down among the now curtained berths,
adjusting his long form to the motion of the express,
lurching to right and to left as they went round a
curve, falling over an occasional pair of shoes and
bringing down lofty reproaches from the sleepy
porter, he penetrated to the day coaches and at last
located his quarry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>They were sitting in a double seat, the younger
man facing the two older ones, and had evidently been
unable to get sleepers. Bi hung around the water-cooler
at the far end of the car until he had laid out
his plans; then he sauntered up to the vacant seat
behind the three men and dropped noiselessly into its
depths, drawing his hat down well over his face,
and apparently falling into instant slumber, with
a fair sample of Tinsdale snoring brought in at moderate
distances.</p>

<p>The conversation was earnest, in well-modulated
voices, and hard to follow connectedly, for the men
knew how to talk without seeming to the outside
world to be saying anything intelligible. Occasionally
a sentence would come out clear cut in an
interval of the rhythm of the train, but for the
most part Bi could make little or nothing of it.</p>

<p>"In all the years we've been trustees of that
estate we haven't seen her but twice," said one of
the older men; "once at her father's second marriage,
and again at his funeral. Then we only saw
her at a distance. Her stepmother said she was too
grief-stricken to speak with any one, and it was by
the utmost effort she could be present at the service."</p>

<p>"She looked very frail and young," said the other
old man; "and her hair&mdash;I remember her hair!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Bi changed his position cautiously and tried to
peer over the back of his seat, but the voices were
crowded together now, and the younger man was
talking earnestly. He could not catch a syllable.
"Trustees!" That word stayed with him. "Estate"
was another promising one, and the fact that
her hair had been remembered. He nodded his old
head sagaciously, and later when the three men settled
back in their seats more comfortably with their
eyes closed he slid back to the water-cooler and so on
through the sleeper to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Hutton was sleeping the sleep of the unjust,
which means that he woke at the slightest breath, and
Bi's breath was something to wake a heavier sleeper.
So they sat and planned as the train rushed on
through the night. Now and again Bi took a pilgrimage
up to the day coach and back to report the
three travelers still asleep.</p>

<p>About six o'clock in the morning the train slowed
down, and finally came to a thrashing halt, waking
the sleepers uncomfortably and making them conscious
of crunching feet in the cinders outside, and
consulting voices of trainmen busy with a hammer
underneath the car somewhere. Then they drowsed
off to sleep again and the voices and hammering
blended comfortably into their dreams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The passengers in the day coach roused, looked
at their watches, stretched their cramped limbs,
squinted out to see if anything serious was the matter,
and settled into a new position to sleep once more.</p>

<p>Bi, stretched for the nonce upon the long couch
of the drawing-room while his superior occupied the
more comfortable berth, roused to instant action,
slipped out to the platform and took his bearings.
He had lived in that part of the country all his life
and he knew where they ought to be by that
time. Yes, there was the old saw mill down by
Hague's Crossing, and the steeple over by the soft
maple grove just beyond Fox Glove. It would not
be a long walk, and they had a garage at Fox Glove!</p>

<p>He sauntered along the cinder path; discovered
that the trouble with the engine was somewhat
serious, requiring to wait for help, took a glimpse
into the day coach ahead to assure himself that the
three men were still safely asleep, and sauntered
back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>His entrance roused the sleeper, who was on the
alert instantly.</p>

<p>"Say, we got a hot box an' a broken engyne!"
Bi announced. "It'll take us some time. We ain't
fur from Fox Glove. We could santer over an' git
a car an' beat 'em to it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"We could?" said Hutton. "You sure? No
chances, mind you!"</p>

<p>"Do it easy. Those guys are asleep. They
won't get to the Junction 'fore ten o'clock, mebbe
later, an' they can't possibly get to our place
'fore 'leven."</p>

<p>"Lead the way!" ordered Hutton, cramming
himself into his coat and hat.</p>

<p>"Better slide down on the other side," whispered
Bi as they reached the platform. "We kin
go back round the train an' nobody'll notice."</p>

<p>As if they were only come out to see what was the
matter they idled along the length of the train
around out of sight, slid down the bank, took a shortcut
across a meadow to a road, and were soon well on
their way to Fox Glove in the early cool of the spring
morning, a strangely mated couple bent on mischief.</p>

<p>Back on the cinder track the express waited,
dreamily indifferent, with a flagman ahead and behind
to guard its safety, and while men slept the
enemy took wings and flew down the white morning
road to Tinsdale, but no one ran ahead with a little
red flag to the gray cottage where slept Betty, to
warn her, though perchance an angel with a flaming
sword stood invisibly to guard the way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> had just finished feeding the chickens when
the automobile drew up at the door, and he hurried
around the house to see who it might be. He was
rather looking for the return of that nice lawyer
again. He felt the family expected him some time
soon. Perhaps he would be to breakfast and mother
would want some fresh eggs.</p>

<p>They had dropped Bi at the edge of the village
and there were only Hutton and the driver who had
brought them. Bi had no mind to get mixed up in
this affair too openly. He valued his standing in his
home town, and did not wish to lose it. He had an
instinct that what he was doing might make him
unpopular if it became known. Besides, he had another
ax to grind.</p>

<p>Bob did not like the looks of the strange dark
man who got out of the car and came into the yard
with the air of a thrashing machine bolting into whatever
came in his way. He stood sturdily and waited
until he was asked who lived there, and admitted with
a stingy "yes" that it was Mrs. Carson's house. A
thundering knock on the front door followed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the other man in the car got out and came into the
yard behind the first.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't take the door down," snapped
Bob, and scuttled around the house to warn his
mother, aware that he had been rude, and glad of it.</p>

<p>It was Betty who came to the door, for Ma was
frying bacon and eggs for breakfast, and Bob hadn't
been quite soon enough. She started back with a
scream, and eluding the hand that reached for her
arm, fairly flew back to the kitchen, taking refuge
behind Mrs. Carson, with her eyes wild with fear and
her hand on her heart, while Hutton strode after her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson wheeled around with her knife in
her hand and faced him:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by coming into my house
this way, I'd like to know?" she demanded angrily,
putting her arm around Betty.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Hutton, a poor apology
for courtesy slipping into his manner. "I don't
suppose you know it, but that is my wife you are
harboring there, and she ran away from home several
months ago! I have just discovered her whereabouts
and have come to take her away!"</p>

<p>Ma straightened up with the air of a queen and
a judge, while Betty stifled a scream and in a small
voice full of terror cried: "It isn't true, Mrs. Carson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
it isn't true! Oh, <i>mother</i>, don't let him take me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson pushed Betty behind her, the knife
still in her other hand, and answered with dignity:</p>

<p>"You've made a big mistake, Mr. Herbert
Hutton; this isn't your wife at all. I know all
about you."</p>

<p>Hutton put on a look of instant suavity.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, madam, she has told you that,
but I'm sorry to have to tell you that she is not
in her right mind. She made her escape from the
insane asylum."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" shouted Bob, and vanished out the
kitchen door, slamming it behind him.</p>

<p>Emily, frightened and white, stood just outside,
and he nearly knocked her over in his flight. He
pulled her along with him, whispering in her
ear excitedly:</p>

<p>"You beat it down to the fire gong and hit it
for all you're worth! Quick!"</p>

<p>Emily gave him one frightened look and sprang
to action. Her little feet sped down the path to
the lot where hung the big fire gong, like two wild
rabbits running for their life, and in a moment more
the loud whang of alarm rang through the little town,
arousing the "gang" and greatly disconcerting Bi,
who was craning his neck at the station and watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the fast-growing speck down the railroad track.
That sure was the train coming already. How had
they made it so soon?</p>

<p>But Bob was on his stomach in the road scuttling
the ship that was to have carried away the princess.
The chauffeur was fully occupied in the house, for he
had been ordered to follow and be ready to assist in
carrying away an insane person, and he had no
thought for his car at present. It was an ugly job,
and one that he didn't like, but he was getting big
pay, and such things had to be done.</p>

<p>Bob's knife was sharp. He always kept it in good
condition. It did many of the chores about the
house, and was cunning in its skill. It cut beautiful
long punctures in the four tires, until there was
no chance at all of that car's going on its way
for some time to come. Then he squirmed his way
out on the opposite side from the house, slid along
by the fence to the side door, around to the back
like a flash and without an instant's hesitation hauled
up his elaborate system of drainage. He stuck the
longest conductor pipe through the open window of
the old laundry, clutched at the sill and swung inside,
drawing the pipe in after him.</p>

<p>The altercation in the kitchen had reached white
heat. Hutton's suavity was fast disappearing behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a loud angry tone. He had about sized up Ma
and decided to use force.</p>

<p>
It was a tense moment when Bob, his hasty arrangements made, silently swung
open the laundry door in full range of the uninvited guests and waited for the
psychological moment. Mrs. Carson had dropped her knife and seized the smoking
hot frying-pan <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of bacon as a weapon. She was
cool and collected,</span> but one could see in her eyes the little devil of
battle that sometimes sat in Bob's eyes as she swung the frying-pan back for a
blow. Suddenly out flashed a cold steel eye, menacing, unanswerable, looking
straight into her own.
</p>

<p>At that instant, unannounced and unobserved,
through the laundry door lumbered a long ugly tin
conductor pipe, and the deluge began. Straight into
the eyes of the would-be husband it gushed, battering
swashingly down on the cocked revolver, sending it
harmlessly to the floor, where it added to the confusion
by going off with a loud report, and sending
the chauffeur to the shelter of the parlor. Bob never
knew how near he came to killing some one by his
hasty service, and Ma never had the heart to suggest
it. Instead she acted promptly and secured the
weapon before the enemy had time to recover from
his shock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob, in the laundry, standing on a chair mounted
on a board across the bathtub, sturdily held his
wobbling conductor pipe and aimed it straight to the
mark. Of course he knew that even a well-filled
phalanx of hogsheads could not hold the enemy forever,
but he was counting on the fire company to
arrive in time to save the day.</p>

<p>Gasping, clawing the air, ducking, diving here
and there to escape the stream, Herbert Hutton presented
a spectacle most amusing and satisfying to
Bob's boy mind.</p>

<p>"Beat it, Lizzie, beat it! Beat it!" he shouted
above the noise of the pouring waters. But Betty,
white with horror, seemed to have frozen to the spot.
She could not have moved if she had tried, and
her brain refused to order her to try. She felt
as if the end of everything had come and she
were paralyzed.</p>

<p>Down the street with dash and flourish, licking
up excitement like a good meal, dashed the gang,
the fire chief ostentatiously arraying himself in rubber
coat and helmet as he stood on the side of the
engine, while the hysterical little engine bell banged
away, blending with the sound of the bell of the
incoming train at the station. Bi, with his mouth
stretched wide, and one foot holding him for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
train while the other urged toward the fire and
excitement, vibrated on the platform, a wild figure
of uncertainty. Where Duty and Inclination both
called, Cupidity still had the upper hand.</p>

<p>For once Bi did not have to act a part as he stood
watching the three travelers descend from the train.
The excitement in his face was real and his gestures
were quite natural, even the ones made by his one
and only long waving top-lock of gray hair that
escaped all bounds as his hat blew off with the
suction of the train. Bi rushed up to the three
men wildly:</p>

<p>"Say, was you goin' down to Carson's house
after that Hope girl?" he demanded loudly.</p>

<p>The three men surveyed him coldly, and the
young one gave him a decided shove:</p>

<p>"That will do, my friend," he said firmly. "We
don't need any of your assistance."</p>

<p>"But I got a line on this thing you'll want to
know," he insisted, hurrying alongside. "There's a
guy down there in a car goin' to take her away. He
ain't been gone long, but you won't find her 'thout
my help. He's goin' to take her to a insane institution.
I let on I was helpin' him an' I found out
all about it."</p>

<p>"What's all this?" said Reyburn, wheeling about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and fixing the old fellow with a muscular young
shake that made his toothless jaws chatter. "How
long ago did he go? What kind of a looking man
was he?"</p>

<p>"Lemme go!" whined Bi, playing to make time,
one cunning eye down the road. "I ain't as young
as I used to be, an' I can't stand gettin' excited. I
got a rig here a purpose, an' I'll take you all right
down, an' then ef he's gone, an' I s'pose he must be,
'cause your train was late, why, we'll foller."</p>

<p>"Well, quick, then!" said Reyburn, climbing
into the shackley spring wagon that Bi indicated, the
only vehicle in view. The two trustees climbed
stiffly and uncertainly into the back seat as if they
felt they were risking their lives, and Bi lumbered
rheumatically into the driver's place and took up the
lines. It appeared that the only living thing in Tinsdale
that wasn't awake and keen to go to the fire was
that horse, and Bi had to do quite a little urging
with the stump of an old whip. So, reluctantly, they
joined the procession toward the Carson house.</p>

<p>As the stream from the hogshead gurgled smaller,
and the victim writhed out of its reach and began to
get his bearings, suddenly the outside kitchen door
burst open and a crew of rubber-coated citizens
sprang in, preceded by a generous stream of chemicals
which an ardent young member of the company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
set free indiscriminately in his excitement. It struck
the right man squarely in the middle and sent him
sprawling on the floor.</p>

<p>Bob dropped the conductor pipe in exhausted
relief and flew to the scene of action. It had been
fearful to be held from more active service so long.
Emily, outside, could be seen dancing up and down
excitedly and directing the procession, with frightened
shouts, "In there! In the kitchen! Quick!"
as the neighbors and townsmen crowded in and filled
the little kitchen demanding to know where the
fire was.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carson with dignity stepped forward to
explain:</p>

<p>"There ain't any fire, friends, an' I don't know
how you all come to get here, but I reckon the Lord
sent you. You couldn't a-come at a better moment.
We certainly was in some trouble, an' I'll be obliged
to you all if you'll just fasten that man up so't he
can't do any more harm. He came walkin' in here
tryin' to take away a member of my family by force,
an' he pointed this at me!"</p>

<p>She lifted the incriminating weapon high where
they could all see.</p>

<p>Herbert Hutton, struggling to his feet in the
crowd, began to understand that this was no place
for him, and looked about for an exit, but none presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
itself. The chauffeur had vanished and was
trying to make out what had happened to his car.</p>

<p>Hutton, brought to bay, turned on the crowd like
a snarling animal, although the effect was slightly
spoiled by his drabbled appearance, and roared
out insolently:</p>

<p>"The woman doesn't know what she's talking
about, men; she's only frightened. I came here after
my wife, and I intend to take her away with me!
She escaped from an insane asylum some time ago,
and we've been looking for her ever since. This
woman is doing a very foolish and useless thing
in resisting me, for the law can take hold of
her, of course."</p>

<p>The crowd wavered and looked uncertainly at
Mrs. Carson and at Betty cowering horrified behind
her, and Hutton saw his advantage:</p>

<p>"Men," he went on, "there is one of your own
townsmen who knows me and can vouch for me.
A Mr. Gage. Abijah Gage. If you will just look
him up&mdash;he was down at the station a few minutes
ago. He knows that all I am saying is true!"</p>

<p>A low sound like a rumble went over the little
audience and they seemed to bunch together and
look at one another while some kind of an understanding
traveled from eye to eye. An articulate syllable,
"Bi!" breathed in astonishment, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
again "Bi!" in contempt. Public opinion, like a
panther crouching, was forming itself ready to
spring, when suddenly a new presence was felt in the
room. Three strangers had appeared and somehow
quietly gotten into the doorway. Behind them,
stretching his neck and unable to be cautious any
longer, appeared Bi's slouching form. Crouching
Public Opinion caught sight of him and showed its
teeth, but was diverted by the strangers.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, from the corner behind Ma,
slipped Betty with outstretched hands, like a lost
thing flying to its refuge, straight to the side of
the handsome young stranger.</p>

<p>He put out his hands and drew her to his side
with a protecting motion, and she whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell, them, please; oh, make them understand."</p>

<p>Then Reyburn, with her hand still protectingly
in his, spoke:</p>

<p>"What that man has just said is a lie!"</p>

<p>Hutton looked up, went deadly white and reeled
as he saw the two elderly men.</p>

<p>The crowd drew a united breath and stood
straighter, looking relieved. Bi blanched, but did
not budge. Whatever happened he was in with both
crowds. Reyburn continued:</p>

<p>"I carry papers in my pocket which give authority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to arrest him. If the sheriff is present will he
please take charge of him. His name is Herbert
Hutton, and he is charged with trying to make this
lady marry him under false pretenses in order to get
control of her property. She is not his wife, for she
escaped before the ceremony was performed. I
know, for I was present. These two gentlemen with
me are the trustees of her estate."</p>

<p>Estate!</p>

<p>The neighbors looked at Betty respectfully.</p>

<p>Bi dropped his jaw perceptibly and tried to
figure out how that would affect him. The sheriff
stepped forward to magnify his office, and the silence
was impressive, almost reverent. In the midst of it
broke Bob's practical suggestion:</p>

<p>"Shut him in the coal shed. It's got a padlock an'
is good an' strong. He can't kick it down."</p>

<p>Then the law began to take its course, the fire
gang stepped out, and Mrs. Carson set to work
to clean up. In the midst of it all Reyburn looked
down at Betty, and Betty looked up at Reyburn,
and they discovered in some happy confusion that
they still had hold of hands. They tried to cover
their embarrassment by laughing, but something
had been established between them that neither
could forget.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days that followed were full of bliss and
peace to Betty. With Hutton safely confined in the
distant city, and a comfortable sum of her accumulated
allowance in the Tinsdale bank, with a thorough
understanding between herself and her trustees
and the knowledge that her estate was large
enough to do almost anything in reason that she
wished to do with it, and would be hers in three
weeks, life began to take on a different look to the
poor storm-tossed child. The days in the Carson
home were all Thanksgivings now, and every member
of the family was as excited and happy as every
other member. There were arguments long and
earnest between Betty and her benefactor as to how
much she might in reason be allowed to do for the
family now that she had plenty of money, but in the
end Betty won out, declaring that she had wished
herself on this family in her distress, and they took
her as a man does when he marries, for better
for worse. Now that the worse had passed by she
was theirs for the better, and she intended to exercise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the privilege of a daughter of the house for the
rest of her natural life.</p>

<p>Bi Gage was worried. He was still trying to
get something out of the estate for his part in the
exercises, and he vibrated between Tinsdale and
Warren Reyburn's office working up his case. The
five-thousand-dollar reward was as yet unpaid, and
the papers he held didn't seem to impress the functionaries
nearly so much as he had expected. It
began to look as though Bi had missed his chances
in life once more, and when he took his old seat in the
fire-house and smoked, he said very little. Popular
Opinion was still crouching with her eye in his
direction and it behooved him to walk cautiously
and do nothing to offend. So while he smoked he
cogitated in his cunning little brain, and hatched
out a plan by which he might get in with the heiress
later, perhaps, when things had quieted down a little
and she had her money.</p>

<p>Betty received a pitiful letter from her stepmother,
trying to explain away her part in the affair
and professing to be so relieved at the news that
Betty was still alive and well that she cared nothing
about anything else, not even the fact that poor dear
Herbert was landed in jail, or that the fortune which
she had schemed so long to keep in her own power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was wrested from her so ignominiously. She begged
Betty to come back to their home and "be happy
again together."</p>

<p>But Betty was so happy where she was that she
could afford to be generous and try to forget her
wrongs. She wrote a decent little note gently but
firmly declining to come "home" ever again, making
it quite plain that she was no longer deceived by
honeyed phrases, and closing with a request that
if in future any communication might be necessary
it should be made through her lawyer, Mr.
Warren Reyburn.</p>

<p>This same Warren Reyburn had returned to his
city office in a very much exalted state of mind.
He could not get away from that little hand of
Betty's that had been laid so tremblingly and confidingly
in his; and yet how could he, a poverty-stricken
lawyer with absolutely no prospects at all,
ever dare to think of her, a lady of vast estates. Still,
there was some comfort in the fact that he had still
some business to transact for her, and would have
to return to Tinsdale again. He might at least see
her once more. So he solaced himself on his return
trip, feeling that he had done some good work, and
that he would have a pleasant report to give to Jane
Carson when he called upon her, as he meant to do
the next day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>He arrived at home to find James Ryan in a great
state of excitement. A pile of mail had arrived,
and he had memorized the return addresses on the
outside of all the envelopes. One was from a big
corporation, and another bore a name widely spoken
of in the circles of the world of finance, Jimmie in
close council with Jane Carson, had decided that it
must be from that person who called up twice on the
'phone and swore such terrible oaths when he found
that Reyburn was away.</p>

<p>Jimmie hovered nervously about, putting things
to rights, while Reyburn read his mail. He had come
to the smallest envelope of all, a plain government
envelope now, and nothing had developed. Jimmie
saw his first place fast slipping away from him and
his heart grew heavy with fear. Perhaps after all
nothing good had turned up yet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Reyburn sprang up and came toward
him with an open letter, holding out his hand in a
joyous greeting:</p>

<p>"Read that, Ryan! We're made at last, and I
shan't have to let you go after all!"</p>

<p>Ryan read, the letters dancing before his delighted
eyes, every one wearing an orange blossom on
its brow. It was from an old established and influential
firm, asking Reyburn to take full charge of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
their law business, and saying they had been referred
to him by two old friends in Boston, who by the
way were Betty's two trustees.</p>

<p>"Come on, Ryan, come out to lunch with me!
We've got to celebrate," said Reyburn. "I have a
hunch somehow that you have been the one that
brought me this good luck. You and a Miss Jane
Carson. You both share alike, I guess, but you
were the first with your five-thousand-dollar
reward story."</p>

<p>"Jane Carson!" said Jimmie mystified. "Why,
<i>she's</i> my <i>girl!</i>"</p>

<p>"Your girl?" said Reyburn, a queer look coming
in his eyes. "You don't say! Well, you're in
some luck, boy, with a girl like that! And, by the
way, next time you see her, ask her to show you
her wedding dress!"</p>

<p>And not another word would Reyburn tell him,
though he recurred frequently to the subject during
the very excellent lunch which they had together in
friendly companionship.</p>

<p>They spent the afternoon composing the brief
and comprehensive letter in response to the momentous
one of the morning, and in the evening together
they sought out Jane Carson, Reyburn staying only
long enough to outline the ending of the Elizabeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Stanhope story, while Jimmie remained to hear the
beginning, and get a glimpse of the wedding gown,
which Reyburn assured Jane he was sure she need
never return. He said he thought if the owner of it
was married ever in the future she would be likely
to want a gown that had no unpleasant associations.</p>

<p>Great excitement prevailed in Tinsdale as the
weeks went by. Betty had bought the lots either side
of the Carson house, and wonderful improvements
were in progress. A windmill was being erected and
water pipes laid scientifically. Workmen arrived,
some of them from the village, some from the city.
Extensive excavations went on about the old house,
and stone arrived. It began to be whispered about
that "Miss Stanhope," as Betty was now called, was
going to build the house all over and all of stone.</p>

<p>The work went forward rapidly as work can go
when there is money enough behind it, and the family,
living in the little old part of the house, and still
using the faithful tin bath-tub and shower of Bob's
manufacture, now looked forward to real bathrooms
on the bedroom floor, with tiled floors and
porcelain fittings. Large windows cropped out on
the new walls that were going up, a wide stone chimney
and porches. A charming little stone affair in
the back yard that went up so quietly it was hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
noticed until it was done suddenly became the home
of a big gray car that arrived in town one morning.
Betty gave up her position at the Hathaways so
that she could have more time to superintend the
work and see that it was just as she wanted it, and
she and Bob spent hours going over the plans together,
he making many wise suggestions. Mrs.
Hathaway called her "Miss Stanhope" with elaborate
ceremony, and made Elise kiss her whenever
she met her.</p>

<p>Betty went to a near-by town and bought some
pretty clothes, and a lot of things for Ma and Emily
and Bob. A beautiful new piano came by express
and took the place of Mrs. Barlow's tinpanny one.</p>

<p>Then Betty went up to the city and bought more
things, furniture and silver and curtains and rugs,
and brought Jane back with her to take a rest and
see the little old house once more before it became
the big new house, and stay until she was ready to
be married; for Betty was determined to have the
house ready for Jane's wedding.</p>

<p>When all the new beautiful things began to arrive
Betty told Ma that she had taken her in when she
was poor and homeless and absolutely penniless, and
now all these things were her reward, and Betty
couldn't do enough ever to thank her for what she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
had done for her. They had offered a five-thousand-dollar
reward for news of her, and Ma had done
more than ten thousand and thousands of thousands
of dollars' worth of holding back news about her,
and she was never going to get done giving her
her reward.</p>

<p>Of course Betty brought Nellie home, too, and
established her in a lovely new room just fit for a
young girl, and began to pet her and fix her up with
pretty things as any loving sister might do if she
had money of her own.</p>

<p>All this time Reyburn had much business to transact
in Tinsdale, for Betty had asked him to look
after all the little details about the building for her,
and he had to come down every week-end and look
things over to see that she was not being cheated.
And once he brought Jimmie down with him for
Ma to look over and approve and they had a wonderful
time with the two best hens in the hen-coop for
dinner. Ryan incidentally gave his approval
to Betty.</p>

<p>During these visits Reyburn was making great
strides in the wisdom and the knowledge of the love
of God. One could not be in that family over Sunday
and not feel the atmosphere of a Christian
home. Even Jimmie felt it and said he liked it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that he wanted his house to be that way when he
had one. He went obediently to church with Jane,
and marveled at the way social classes were getting
all muddled up in his world.</p>

<p>The Christmas time was coming on when the
house finally got itself completed and was ready for
living, and with holly and mistletoe and laurel they
made it gay for the wedding. Betty spent several
days with Jane in New York picking out Jane's
"trooso" things, and then a few more days doing
some shopping of her own, and at last the wedding
day arrived.</p>

<p>Nobody thought it queer, though Jimmie felt
just the least bit shy when the two trustees of Betty's
estate arrived the night before from Boston and
incorporated themselves into the wedding party. Ma
seemed to think it was all right, so nobody said anything
about it.</p>

<p>But after the ceremony when Jane and Jimmie
were happily married, Jane looking very young and
pretty indeed in Betty's old wedding gown, veil and
slippers and all, and standing under the holly bell in
the laurel arch to be congratulated just as it had been
arranged, there suddenly came a hush over everybody.
Jane noticed for the first time that Betty
was not anywhere in the room. Then everybody's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
eyes went to the wide staircase, and here came Betty
trailing down the stairs on the arm of Reyburn,
wearing still the little white organdie she had worn a
few minutes before as a bridesmaid, only she had
thrown aside the rose-colored sash and put over her
brow a simple tulle veil, and her arms were full of
little pink rosebuds and lilies of the valley.</p>

<p>Up they walked in front of the minister just
where the others had stood, and were married with
the same sweet simple service, and everybody was so
surprised and delighted and excited and breathless
that Bob simply couldn't stand it. He slipped into
the little music room where the piano had been installed,
turned a handspring on the floor, and then
sat down and played chopsticks on the piano with
all the pedals on, till Ma had to send Emily in to
stop him.</p>
